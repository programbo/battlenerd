# Squad Delay Battle Positions

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Complex/Urban Terrain
- Scale: Squad level (9-12 personnel)
- Domain: Infantry Operations with Engineering Support

## Tactical Definition

Squad Delay Battle Positions emphasize survivability and concealment through
hand-constructed fighting positions and natural resources. These positions are
made up of pairs and team fighting positions that can be arrayed to act either
on a per-squad basis or as part of a larger platoon defensive system.

## Implementation

### Position Construction

1. Basic Layout

   - T-shaped excavation pattern with vertical arm toward enemy
   - Fighting positions at horizontal ends of T-pattern
   - Maximum frontage of 100 meters per position
   - Overhead camouflage netting integrated
   - Communication trenches between positions
   - Interlocking fields of fire
   - Multiple ammunition storage points

2. Construction Methods
   - Hand tools for stealth when mechanization unavailable
   - Local material utilization:
     - Soil for protective walls
     - Rocks for reinforcement
     - Vegetation for concealment
   - Built for extended occupation
   - Progressive improvement plan
   - Drainage system integration
   - Overhead protection requirements

### Fighting Positions

1. Pairs Position

   - T-pattern basic construction
   - Two defenders at horizontal ends
   - Clear fields of fire forward
   - Protected communication trench
   - Overhead protection when possible
   - Multiple firing ports/levels
   - Integrated sensor systems

2. Team Position
   - Accommodates Machine Gun (MG) and Grenade Launcher (GL)
   - Enhanced protection features
   - Multiple firing ports
   - Integrated ammunition storage
   - Command and control position
   - Sensor integration capability
   - Emergency evacuation routes

### Tactical Employment

1. Position Selection

   - Commander assesses likely enemy approach
   - Positions Machine Gun (MG) for maximum effect
   - Distributes remaining elements for depth
   - Ensures mutual support between positions
   - Maintains security elements forward
   - Establishes observation posts
   - Plans withdrawal routes

2. Fire Distribution
   - Co-locate MG and GL in team structure
   - Maximize firepower concentration
   - Redistribute rifle and anti-armor elements
   - Maintain overlapping fields of fire
   - Enable depth defense capability
   - Plan final protective fires
   - Establish engagement areas

### Command and Control

1. Communication Systems

   - Hardened communication lines between positions
   - Redundant signal methods
   - Clear command relationships
   - Established reporting procedures
   - Emergency signals protocol
   - Alternative communication plans
   - Visual signal system

2. Battle Management
   - Clear engagement criteria
   - Specified withdrawal conditions
   - Support coordination procedures
   - Ammunition management
   - Casualty evacuation plans
   - Resupply procedures
   - Position handover protocols

## Common Errors

1. Construction Faults

   - Poor drainage planning
   - Inadequate overhead cover
   - Weak position camouflage
   - Limited fields of fire
   - Poor communication trenches

2. Tactical Mistakes
   - Insufficient depth in defense
   - Poor mutual support
   - Weak withdrawal routes
   - Limited observation capability
   - Inadequate ammunition storage

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports delay operations
- Enables force preservation
- Facilitates area denial
- Supports information operations
- Enables psychological effects
- Integrates with withdrawal plans
- Supports deception operations
- Enables defensive depth

## Training Considerations

1. Construction Techniques

   - Position layout methods
   - Material selection
   - Camouflage procedures
   - Drainage implementation
   - Improvement processes

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Fire control measures
   - Withdrawal procedures
   - Support coordination
   - Battle handover
   - Emergency actions

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for position planning
- Essential for fire distribution
- Key for mutual support calculation
- Important for withdrawal timing
- Vital for engagement sequencing
- Crucial for resource management
- Enables pattern analysis
- Supports tactical decision-making
