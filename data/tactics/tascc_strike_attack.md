# Strike Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Platoon to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Information Operations

## Tactical Definition

Strike Attack is a devastating urban operation tactic designed to deliver heavy
munitions or demolition charges onto an objective, causing significant damage
and casualties to defenders while maintaining compliance with information
warfare objectives. The tactic integrates Purple Roof Knocking procedures to
enable civilian evacuation and support strategic messaging.

## Implementation

### Preparation Phase

1. Purple Knock Procedure

   - Deploy Purple Smoke rounds ahead of main munitions
   - Signal impending strike to enable evacuation
   - Create tactical confusion among defenders
   - Enable civilian evacuation through marked routes
   - Support information warfare narrative
   - Document evacuation procedures
   - Maintain evidence of warning efforts

2. Intelligence Gathering
   - Deploy Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) for surveillance
   - Conduct loudspeaker announcements in local language
   - Monitor designated evacuation routes
   - Identify defensive positions and strong points
   - Assess structural vulnerabilities
   - Map civilian movement patterns
   - Document defender reactions

### Strike Phase

1. Initial Actions

   - Mark target with purple smoke for final warning
   - Issue final evacuation warnings via loudspeaker
   - Deploy observation systems for effect monitoring
   - Position strike elements in covered locations
   - Establish security cordon around target area
   - Prepare supporting weapon systems
   - Document all warning procedures

2. Engagement Sequence
   - Execute precision munitions strikes on target
   - Deploy thermobaric weapons as required
   - Maintain continuous observation of effects
   - Monitor for collateral damage indicators
   - Adjust fire based on observed effects
   - Document engagement sequence
   - Prepare for follow-on operations

### Post-Strike Operations

1. Assessment

   - Deploy UAS for detailed damage assessment
   - Monitor for survivors requiring assistance
   - Identify remaining threats or strong points
   - Evaluate structural stability of target
   - Plan follow-on tactical actions
   - Document strike effectiveness
   - Update intelligence picture

2. Clearance Operations
   - Issue surrender demands via loudspeaker
   - Deploy proving teams with UAS support
   - Clear rubble systematically and safely
   - Use specialized search dogs for detection
   - Maintain armed launcher coverage
   - Document clearance procedures
   - Preserve evidence as required

### Information Operations

1. Documentation

   - Record all warning procedures
   - Photograph evacuation routes
   - Document civilian movement
   - Maintain strike footage
   - Collect evidence of warnings
   - Record defender reactions
   - Preserve all relevant data

2. Strategic Messaging
   - Emphasize warning procedures
   - Highlight civilian protection measures
   - Document precision of strikes
   - Show military necessity
   - Demonstrate proportionality
   - Support strategic narrative
   - Enable future operations

## Common Errors

1. Preparation Failures

   - Insufficient evacuation time provided
   - Poor munitions effect calculation
   - Inadequate post-strike assessment
   - Weak information operations integration
   - Limited documentation procedures

2. Execution Mistakes
   - Premature strike initiation
   - Poor effects observation
   - Inadequate security measures
   - Limited contingency planning
   - Insufficient evidence collection

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Enables systematic clearance
- Facilitates information warfare objectives
- Supports strategic messaging
- Enables force preservation
- Maintains operational tempo
- Supports psychological effects
- Facilitates future operations

## Training Considerations

1. Technical Procedures

   - Munitions effect calculation
   - Civilian evacuation procedures
   - UAS integration methods
   - Information operations coordination
   - Documentation requirements

2. Tactical Skills
   - Target analysis
   - Effects assessment
   - Security operations
   - Evidence collection
   - Clearance procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for effects calculation
- Essential for pattern recognition
- Key for damage assessment
- Important for evacuation timing
- Vital for documentation analysis
- Crucial for evidence preservation
- Enables effects prediction
- Supports decision-making
