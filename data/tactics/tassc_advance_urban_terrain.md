# TASSC Advance Urban Terrain

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Obscuration

## Tactical Definition

A two-pronged strategy for concealed movement in urban terrain, combining
countermeasures against drone threats with tactical tunneling obscuration. This
approach evolved from effective tank deployment methods in urban environments
during WWII.

## Implementation

### Concealment Strategy

1. Mechanical Concealment

   - Drive Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) into buildings
   - Provides concealment from aerial threats
   - Offers substantial protection
   - Enables tactical tunneling

2. Obscuration Methods
   - Non-toxic glycol vapor from AFVs
   - Specialized low-hazard smoke rockets
   - IR and white phosphorus artillery
   - TI translucent smoke on axis
   - TI opaque obscurants at junctions

### Movement Techniques

1. Building Integration

   - AFVs enter structures directly
   - Use buildings as protective positions
   - Create covered movement routes
   - Maintain concealment from aerial observation

2. Tunneling Operations
   - Create protected routes through buildings
   - Use mechanical breaching equipment
   - Maintain structural integrity
   - Enable force movement under cover

### Transit Security

1. Blast Neutralization

   - Deploy large linear explosive charges
   - Use thermobaric munitions
   - Clear pre-laid IEDs/mines
   - Leverage building architecture for blast effects

2. Civilian Considerations
   - Allow evacuation time
   - Mark routes with purple smoke
   - Issue warnings via loudspeaker
   - Monitor civilian movement

## Common Errors

1. Insufficient structural assessment
2. Poor obscuration timing
3. Inadequate civilian evacuation procedures
4. Improper explosive charge calculation

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban offensive operations
- Supports infiltration missions
- Enables force protection in urban terrain

## Training Considerations

1. AFV-building integration techniques
2. Obscuration employment procedures
3. Explosive charge calculations
4. Civilian interaction protocols

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for route planning
- Essential for timing calculations
- Key for obscuration modeling
- Important for civilian pattern recognition
