# Squad Defence

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad level (9-12 personnel)
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

Squad Defence in the Olvanan doctrine emphasizes the integration of autonomous
systems, remote weapons, and traditional fighting positions to create a layered
defensive system that maximizes combat power while minimizing exposure of
personnel. The tactic incorporates both active and passive defensive measures
with comprehensive sensor coverage.

## Implementation

### Position Construction

1. Primary Fighting Position

   - T-pattern construction method
   - Reinforced overhead protection
   - Multiple firing ports at varied levels
   - Integrated sensor systems
   - Connected to underground shelter
   - Hardened communication lines
   - Emergency escape routes

2. Support Positions
   - Remote Weapon Station (RWS) emplacements
   - UAS/UGV control stations
   - Ammunition storage points
   - Medical treatment area
   - Alternative fighting positions
   - Observation posts
   - Counter-mobility obstacles

### Defensive Systems

1. Sensor Integration

   - Comprehensive surveillance network
   - Personal monitoring systems
   - Connected to underground shelter
   - Automated threat detection
   - Minimal exposure requirement
   - Integrated early warning
   - Counter-UAS capability

2. Weapons Employment
   - Remote Weapon Stations (RWS)
   - Autonomous engagement systems
   - Pre-planned indirect fires
   - Anti-armor positions
   - Machine Gun (MG) positions
   - Command-detonated devices
   - Non-lethal systems

### Battle Procedure

1. Routine Operations

   - Minimal personnel exposure
   - Automated surveillance
   - Regular security patrols
   - System status monitoring
   - Communication checks
   - Sensor data analysis
   - Pattern of life tracking

2. Contact Response
   - Automated initial response
   - Coordinated fire plans
   - UAS/UGV deployment
   - Support weapons integration
   - Counter-attack preparation
   - Withdrawal routes secured
   - Battle damage assessment

### Command and Control

1. Communication Systems

   - Hardened communication lines
   - Redundant signal methods
   - Clear command relationships
   - Established reporting procedures
   - Emergency signals protocol
   - Alternative communication plans
   - Visual signal system

2. Battle Management
   - Clear engagement criteria
   - Specified withdrawal conditions
   - Support coordination procedures
   - Ammunition management
   - Casualty evacuation plans
   - Resupply procedures
   - Position handover protocols

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Over-reliance on technology
   - Poor systems integration
   - Inadequate manual backups
   - Insufficient depth in defense
   - Weak withdrawal planning

2. Tactical Failures
   - Poor coordination
   - Inadequate security
   - Weak command and control
   - Insufficient rehearsal
   - Limited contingency planning

## Integration with Other Tactics

   - Manual backup operations
   - Emergency response drills
   - Sensor operation/maintenance
   - Remote weapon handling

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Position selection methods
   - Fire control measures
   - Battle management
   - Emergency procedures
   - Contingency planning
