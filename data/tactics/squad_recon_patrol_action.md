# Squad Reconnaissance Patrol Action

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Complex/Urban Terrain
- Scale: Squad level (3-4 personnel)
- Domain: Reconnaissance Operations with Unmanned Systems Integration

## Tactical Definition

Olvanan reconnaissance squad (designated Urban Light Action - ULA) operations
for conducting point target reconnaissance through systematic observation post
establishment within non-permissive environments. The ULA emphasizes advanced
man-machine teaming tactics and minimal force signature.

## Implementation

   - Secure communications suite with redundancy
   - Integrated surveillance equipment with data fusion
   - Counter-detection systems
   - Emergency extraction equipment

### Movement Techniques

1. Infiltration Methods
