# Containment Tactics

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Platoon to Company level
- Domain: Combined arms with autonomous systems

## Tactical Definition

Containment is a dual-purpose tactic serving both ethical and tactical
objectives, made feasible through autonomous systems integration. It aims to
minimize delay while reducing risks of bypassing uncleared structures during
advance or around objectives.

## Implementation

### Defensive Considerations

1. Area Isolation

   - Deploy purple fencing against accidental entry into designated zones
   - Establish autonomous weapon system zones with clear boundaries
   - Implement sensor coverage networks for continuous monitoring
   - Position UGVs at key entry points for immediate response
   - Purple-fence areas against accidental civilian entry
   - Create clear delineation between autonomous operation zones and safe areas

2. Civilian Management
   - Issue warnings via UAS loudspeakers before operations commence
   - Establish evacuation corridors with clear markings
   - Deploy Orange Jacket personnel for civilian interface
   - Monitor civilian movement patterns using aerial assets
   - Use purple smoke to warn occupants of impending attacks
   - Allow time for civilian evacuation before engagement

### Offensive Considerations

1. Force Deployment

   - Deploy reinforced mechanized platoon (3 IFVs with 3 UGVs)
   - Position vehicles to form perimeter isolating objectives
   - Establish inward-facing posture for mutual overwatch
   - Deploy infantry sections for local protection
   - Position centuries near vehicles
   - Establish observation posts to secure external approaches

2. Building Entry
   - Issue final evacuation warnings through loudspeaker systems
   - Conduct systematic proving operations with UGVs
   - Deploy robotic systems first for initial clearance
   - Use dogs and drones to identify survivors in structures
   - Maintain armed launcher coverage during proving operations
   - Establish internal security positions after clearance

### Execution Sequence

1. Initial Phase

   - Mark area with purple smoke
   - Deploy warning UAS with loudspeakers
   - Establish purple fence perimeter
   - Position mechanized elements

2. Evacuation Phase

   - Issue evacuation warnings
   - Monitor civilian movement
   - Deploy Orange Jacket personnel
   - Establish safe corridors

3. Containment Phase

   - Deploy autonomous systems
   - Establish observation posts
   - Position reaction forces
   - Maintain perimeter security

4. Clearance Phase
   - Conduct systematic proving
   - Deploy robotic systems
   - Clear structures methodically
   - Establish internal security

## Common Errors

1. Insufficient civilian evacuation time
2. Gaps in containment perimeter
3. Over-reliance on autonomous systems

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports urban assault operations
- Enables systematic clearance
- Facilitates information operations

## Training Considerations

1. Autonomous system integration
2. Civilian interaction procedures
3. Containment perimeter management

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for autonomous zone management
- Essential for civilian pattern recognition
- Key for tactical decision support
