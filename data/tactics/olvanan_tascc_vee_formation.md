# Vee Formation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open to Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations

## Tactical Definition

One of the most common Olvanan tactical formations, the Vee formation is
employed when the direction of enemy engagement is likely from the front.
Traditional team structures are often removed to provide greater centralized
control to the commander.

## Implementation

### Basic Organization

1. Command and Control

   - Squad commander centrally positioned
   - Marksmen lead formation centrally
   - Squad personnel with HE weapons on outside edges
   - 2IC positioned for rapid response
   - Enables immediate shock action forward

2. Force Distribution
   - Two lead elements form Vee points
   - Support weapons distributed for maximum coverage
   - Third element forms reserve with headquarters
   - Maintains tactical flexibility
   - Enables rapid response to contact

### Movement Considerations

1. Formation Control

   - Maximum frontage based on terrain
   - Visual contact maintained between elements
   - Clear lanes of fire established
   - Mutual support between elements
   - Commander controls movement

2. Security Measures
   - Lead elements provide forward security
   - Flank security maintained by Vee shape
   - Rear security from trailing element
   - Overlapping fields of observation
   - Immediate action capabilities

### Contact Response

1. Immediate Actions

   - Lead elements establish base of fire
   - Support weapons engage identified threats
   - Reserve maneuvers as directed
   - Commander coordinates response
   - Maintains formation integrity

2. Maneuver Options
   - Can transition to other formations
   - Enables rapid assault initiation
   - Supports flanking movements
   - Allows for tactical withdrawal
   - Maintains unit cohesion

## Common Errors

1. Excessive spacing between elements
2. Poor visual contact maintenance
3. Inadequate security measures
4. Loss of command and control

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports offensive operations
- Enables rapid transition to assault
- Facilitates tactical flexibility

## Training Considerations

1. Formation spacing control
2. Visual contact procedures
3. Security maintenance
4. Transition techniques

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for movement planning
- Essential for spacing calculations
- Key for security positioning
- Important for transition timing
