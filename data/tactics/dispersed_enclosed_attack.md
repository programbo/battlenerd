# Dispersed Enclosed Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Multiple detachments
- Domain: Combined arms with UAS/sensor integration

## Tactical Definition

Multiple detachments are deployed along independent routes to focus significant
combat power on a key objective. This standard Olvanan tactic is designed to
counter superior enemy sensors and long-range weapons by spreading forces across
urban terrain to avoid bottlenecks and reduce vulnerability to enemy movements.

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Highly trained units capable of quick response attacks
- Suitable for both mounted and dismounted operations
- Essential support elements must include:
  - Engineering support
  - Direct and indirect fire control systems
  - Chemical smoke deployment capabilities
  - Unmanned systems integration

### Phase 1: Confirm, Establish, Recon, Navigate (CERN) Stage

1. Preparation

   - Formation level Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and previously emplaced
     sensor networks conduct broad reconnaissance
   - Remote Reconnaissance Company (RRC) deploys toward urban perimeter
   - Position sensors for ongoing surveillance
   - Autonomous UAS probe attack area to:
     - Update intelligence picture
     - Unmask enemy Counter-UAS (CUAS) capabilities

2. Initial Movement
   - Multiple dispersed penetrations mask true intentions
   - UAS concentrate in maneuver area ahead of forces
   - Common features for all detachments:
     - UAS probes route immediately ahead
     - Fire support elements positioned forward
     - Immediate action on contact uses thermobaric and smoke munitions
     - Capability to outflank blocking positions

### Phase 2: Penetration

1. Force Organization

   - Strike/seizure/storm/confined detachments formed at Forming Up Points
     (FUPs)
   - Security elements dropped off before main advance
   - If surprise lost, commander may:
     - Use cover for enveloping force
     - Deploy Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)/UAS to call for surrender
     - Use thermobaric/less-lethal chemical munitions if refused

2. Engagement Control
   - Risk of confusion high with converging axes
   - Obscuring/incendiary smokes avoided on objective
   - Thermal Imaging (TI) opaque/translucent obscuring used to isolate attack
     area
   - Careful control of supporting fires required

### Phase 3: Consolidation

1. Initial Response

   - Rapidly reduce presence in known enemy areas
   - Move forces from exposed positions shortly after attack
   - Disperse to preselected concealed defensive positions
   - Rely on previously positioned Observation Posts (OPs) for security

2. Static Defense
   - Units equipped with remote weapon systems
   - Maintain static positions with aggressive security patrols
   - Force enemy to expose themselves
   - Robotic control teams regroup with main force

## Common Errors

1. Insufficient coordination between converging elements
2. Over-concentration of forces
3. Poor obscuration control
4. Inadequate security during consolidation

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Combines with obscuration techniques
- Supports larger offensive operations
- Enables exploitation of success

## Training Considerations

1. Extensive rehearsal requirements
2. Complex command and control procedures
3. Detailed coordination measures
4. UAS/UGV integration practice

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for synchronizing multiple elements
- Essential for managing convergence timing
- Key for coordinating supporting fires
- Important for UAS/sensor integration
