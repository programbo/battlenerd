# Non-State Actor Black Flight Operations

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Remote/Rural Terrain
- Scale: Small Unit Operations
- Domain: Clandestine Air Operations

## Tactical Definition

Black flights are clandestine air operations conducted in northern regions for
illegal importations (typically drugs and weapons) and unauthorized personnel
movement. These operations require specific terrain and infrastructure
conditions while maintaining maximum operational security.

## Implementation

### Location Selection

1. Airstrip Requirements

   - Unregulated airstrips
   - Dirt/natural surfaces
   - Unregulated regional airfields
   - Large flat areas (salt flats)
   - Suitable approach/departure paths

2. Infrastructure Considerations
   - Proximity to main supply routes
   - Vehicle access points
   - Alternative egress routes
   - Waterway accessibility
   - Minimal local population

### Ground Operations

1. Pre-Landing Procedures

   - Ground personnel establish security
   - Set out runway lighting/markings
   - Use saloom lanterns or vehicles
   - Position vehicles at runway ends
   - Establish communications

2. Landing Support
   - Final condition updates to pilot
   - Runway condition reports
   - Wind/obstacle information
   - Timing coordination
   - Security confirmation

### Flight Operations

1. Approach Procedures

   - Lower than standard altitude
   - Minimal electronic emissions
   - Low flyover for assessment
   - No landing lights
   - Rapid touchdown execution

2. Ground Phase
   - Immediate link-up with vehicles
   - Rapid cargo transfer
   - Minimal ground time
   - Security maintenance
   - Quick departure preparation

### Exfiltration

1. Vehicle Movement

   - Immediate departure from area
   - Multiple route options
   - Split team movement
   - Counter-surveillance
   - Alternative safe locations

2. Aircraft Departure
   - Minimal delay after offload
   - Low-level exit route
   - Electronic emissions control
   - Alternate return routing
   - Deception procedures

## Common Errors

1. Poor site selection
2. Inadequate security
3. Communication failures
4. Excessive ground time

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports clandestine operations
- Enables rapid movement
- Facilitates covert logistics

## Training Considerations

1. Site selection criteria
2. Ground team procedures
3. Communication protocols
4. Security measures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for pattern analysis
- Essential for site selection
- Key for timing coordination
- Important for route planning
