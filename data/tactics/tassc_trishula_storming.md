# Trishula Storming

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Team level (2-3 personnel)
- Domain: Combined Arms with Breaching Focus

## Tactical Definition

Trishula Storming is the tactical term for breaching an obstacle in urban
terrain utilizing various forms of explosives. Unlike Western practice, while
soldiers work together to overcome obstacles, they typically do not assault an
enclosure together, following the principle that "it is foolish if all rush
together and all die together." This approach emphasizes individual survival
while maintaining tactical effectiveness.

## Implementation

### Blast Breaching Methods

1. Pole Charge Technique

   - Soldier One (Breacher):
     - Moves from final assault position
     - Extends pole charge around corner
     - Places charge against target surface
     - Returns to cover for detonation
     - Confirms breach passable
     - Covers inward movement
     - Maintains tactical overwatch
   - Soldier Two:
     - Moves with second pole charge
     - Places charge against interior wall
     - Exits for detonation
     - Supports follow-on movement
     - Maintains tactical momentum

2. Sequential Breaching
   - Initial Breach:
     - Confirm breach effectiveness
     - Establish security position
     - Enable follow-on movement
     - Maintain tactical tempo
     - Support subsequent breaches
     - Clear initial space
     - Assess structural integrity
   - Follow-on Actions:
     - Position next breach charge
     - Withdraw behind walls
     - Continue systematic breaching
     - Maintain assault momentum

### Alternative Methods

1. Standoff Breaching

   - Initial Actions:
     - Position standoff breacher at safe distance
     - Fire from covered position using remote trigger
     - Confirm breach effectiveness through optics
     - Move breacher forward if required
     - Set up for interior breach sequence
     - Maintain tactical security
     - Enable rapid exploitation

2. Mechanical Breaching
   - Equipment Integration:
     - Deploy specialized breaching tools
     - Maintain tactical security during breach
     - Enable rapid entry capability
     - Support follow-on forces
     - Preserve assault momentum
     - Minimize noise signature
     - Provide alternative breach options

### Tactical Procedures

1. Pre-Breach Actions

   - Conduct detailed target reconnaissance
   - Identify optimal breach points
   - Calculate explosive requirements
   - Position security elements
   - Establish communication protocols
   - Prepare alternate breach plans
   - Rehearse emergency procedures

2. Post-Breach Operations
   - Assess breach effectiveness
   - Clear initial danger area
   - Establish security positions
   - Enable follow-on movement
   - Maintain tactical tempo
   - Document breach effects
   - Prepare subsequent breaches

### Safety Measures

1. Personnel Protection

   - Minimum safe distances calculated
   - Proper cover positions identified
   - Protective equipment requirements
   - Blast/fragmentation considerations
   - Secondary hazard mitigation
   - Emergency medical procedures
   - Evacuation routes planned

2. Structural Considerations
   - Building stability assessment
   - Load-bearing wall identification
   - Collapse hazard evaluation
   - Secondary explosion risks
   - Debris pattern prediction
   - Safe approach routes
   - Emergency egress planning

## Common Errors

1. Technical Errors

   - Poor charge placement
   - Inadequate cover utilization
   - Loss of tactical tempo
   - Insufficient security
   - Weak breach assessment

2. Procedural Mistakes
   - Inadequate reconnaissance
   - Poor communication
   - Weak security measures
   - Limited contingency planning
   - Insufficient rehearsals

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban operations
- Supports building clearance
- Enables force projection
- Facilitates rapid entry
- Supports surprise tactics
- Enables tactical flexibility
- Maintains combat power
- Preserves force security

## Training Considerations

1. Technical Skills

   - Explosive handling procedures
   - Breaching techniques
   - Security maintenance
   - Team coordination
   - Equipment maintenance

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Breach point selection
   - Security positioning
   - Communication protocols
   - Emergency procedures
   - After-action assessment
