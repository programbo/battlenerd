# TASSC Chokepoint Transit

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Platoon level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

TASSC Chokepoint Transit is a specialized movement technique for traversing
urban chokepoints and danger areas while maintaining maximum force protection.
The tactic integrates autonomous systems, obscuration, and coordinated movement
to minimize exposure during necessary transit of vulnerable areas, particularly
in urban terrain where movement is channelized.

## Implementation

### Preparation Phase

1. Reconnaissance

   - Deploy UAS for aerial observation
   - Use UGVs for initial probing
   - Identify potential enemy positions
   - Map all possible routes
   - Locate covered positions
   - Identify support-by-fire positions
   - Plan emergency actions

2. Support Setup
   - Position support weapons
   - Establish observation posts
   - Deploy autonomous systems
   - Prepare obscuration plan
   - Position reaction forces
   - Establish communications
   - Enable rapid response

### Movement Phase

1. Initial Actions

   - Deploy obscuration at key points
   - UGVs probe immediate danger area
   - Establish overwatch positions
   - Position support weapons
   - Ready reaction elements
   - Verify communications
   - Enable rapid response

2. Transit Sequence
   - Lead elements move under cover
   - Maintain continuous observation
   - Support weapons ready
   - UAS provides overhead coverage
   - Reaction force prepared
   - Maintain tactical tempo
   - Enable rapid reinforcement

### Security Operations

1. Overwatch Elements

   - Maintain observation of danger areas
   - Monitor adjacent structures
   - Track potential threats
   - Support movement elements
   - Enable rapid response
   - Coordinate fire support
   - Maintain communications

2. Support Elements
   - Position support weapons
   - Maintain suppressive capability
   - Cover likely enemy positions
   - Enable rapid engagement
   - Support movement groups
   - Maintain tactical flexibility
   - Preserve combat power

### Emergency Procedures

1. Contact Response

   - Immediate suppressive fire
   - Deploy additional obscuration
   - Move to covered positions
   - Execute battle drills
   - Enable rapid withdrawal
   - Support engaged elements
   - Maintain unit integrity

2. Contingency Actions
   - Alternative route activation
   - Reaction force deployment
   - Support weapons engagement
   - Casualty evacuation procedures
   - Emergency extraction plans
   - Rally point procedures
   - Maintain tactical control

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Poor route selection
   - Inadequate reconnaissance
   - Weak obscuration plan
   - Limited support positioning
   - Insufficient rehearsal

2. Tactical Failures
   - Loss of momentum
   - Poor coordination
   - Inadequate security
   - Weak command and control
   - Limited contingency planning

## Integration with Other Tactics
