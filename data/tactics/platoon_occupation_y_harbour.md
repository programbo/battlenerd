defense and is readily adapted to execute an ambush.

## Implementation

### Formation Structure

1. Squad Organization

   - Three squads with identical layout
   - Each squad contains three teams:
     - Scout team (lead)
     - Launcher team (middle)
     - Machine gun team (trail)
   - Squads linked by senior sergeant or commander

2. Command Element
   - Platoon commander between second/third squads
   - Senior sergeant between first/second squads
   - Positions may be interchanged based on threat
   - Enables effective command and control
   - Maintains tactical flexibility

### Occupation Sequence

1. Initial Actions

   - Commander determines center/apex of harbour
   - First two squads face likely enemy direction
   - Third squad closes to form Y shape
   - Establish all-round security
   - Set up command position

2. Movement Control
   - First squad moves through apex
   - Scout team leads movement
   - Followed by launcher team
   - Machine gun team moves last
   - Senior sergeant controls spacing

### Tactical Employment

1. Defensive Configuration

   - Good all-round defense
