# 3D Defilade

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

3D Defilade extends traditional defilade concepts to account for modern
multi-level threats including aerial observation, high-rise positions, and
UAV/Drone threats. The tactic emphasizes protection of personnel and material
from enemy observation and fire through comprehensive analysis and exploitation
of three-dimensional terrain features.

## Implementation

### Position Analysis

1. Terrain Assessment

   - Calculate minimum safe distances from vertical threats
   - Map dead spaces and vulnerable areas
   - Identify natural and artificial cover offering protection from:
     - Ground-level observation (0-3m height)
     - Elevated positions (3m-30m)
     - Aerial observation (30m+)
   - Evaluate terrain sustainability
   - Document weather impact on cover effectiveness
   - Plan alternative position options

2. Coverage Requirements
   - Maximum coverage from known threat vectors
   - 75% or greater coverage from primary threat direction
   - Minimum 50% coverage from secondary threats
   - Minimal exposure to elevated positions
   - Identify and avoid convergence points
   - Maintain distance from tall structures
   - Enable overhead concealment

### Protection Measures

1. Physical Protection

   - Utilize natural terrain features
   - Construct overhead protection
   - Create protected movement routes
   - Establish alternate positions
   - Enable rapid displacement
   - Maintain concealment
   - Ensure structural integrity

2. Counter-Observation
   - Minimize electronic signatures
   - Employ multi-spectral camouflage
   - Control light and noise
   - Manage thermal signatures
   - Reduce movement patterns
   - Deploy deception measures
   - Enable passive observation

### Defensive Systems

1. Sensor Integration

   - Deploy comprehensive sensor network
   - Establish multi-level coverage
   - Enable automated threat detection
   - Integrate early warning systems
   - Monitor dead spaces
   - Maintain redundant systems
   - Enable rapid response

2. Weapons Employment
   - Position Remote Weapon Stations (RWS)
   - Establish interlocking fields of fire
   - Cover vertical approach routes
   - Enable standoff engagement
   - Maintain mutual support
   - Integrate indirect fire support
   - Preserve combat power

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Poor position selection
   - Inadequate vertical analysis
   - Weak sensor integration
   - Limited fields of fire
   - Insufficient protection

2. Tactical Failures
   - Incomplete 3D analysis
   - Poor system integration
   - Weak mutual support
   - Limited contingency planning
   - Insufficient rehearsal

## Integration with Other Tactics
