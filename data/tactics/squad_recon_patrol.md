## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Complex/Urban Terrain
- Scale: Squad level
- Domain: Reconnaissance Operations

## Tactical Definition

Olvanan reconnaissance squad (designated ULA) operations for conducting point
target reconnaissance through observation post establishment within
non-permissive environments, emphasizing man-machine teaming tactics.

## Implementation

### Squad Composition

1. Team Structure
