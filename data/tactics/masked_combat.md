# Masked Combat

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Multi-domain with emphasis on concealment

## Tactical Definition

Masked Combat extends beyond simple concealment, incorporating protection,
deception, and engagement masking. The concept draws from ancient symbolism of
masks, emphasizing deception and misleading action while providing both
concealment and physical protection.

## Implementation

### Concealment Strategy

1. Environmental Exploitation

   - Urban areas provide superior physical/electromagnetic concealment
   - Critical during loitering munitions threat periods
   - Exploitation of urban masking protects platforms
   - Focus on minimal detection signature

2. Sensor Considerations
   - Accept partial force detection likelihood
   - Account for:
     - Overhead sensor technology
     - Robotic reconnaissance platforms
     - Civilian presence information leakage
     - IT infrastructure vulnerabilities

### Deception Operations

1. Position Masking

   - Move vehicles between actual/deception positions
   - Conduct minor defensive works at multiple locations
   - Create deliberate ambiguity
   - Construct multiple defensive positions
   - Maximize tactical options

2. Camouflage Techniques
   - Disguise armored vehicles as:
     - Trucks
     - Small buildings
     - Material stockpiles
   - Employ advanced camouflage methods
   - Focus on urban-specific concealment

### Blind Engagement

1. Digital Integration

   - Use digitized fire control systems
   - Employ predictive target laying
   - Enable engagement through barriers
   - Maintain concealment during engagement

2. Engagement Methods
   - Machine guns and cannon fire through barriers
   - Initial rounds breach obstacles
   - Subsequent rounds engage target
   - Maintain firing position concealment

### Interior Maneuver

1. Defensive Preparations

   - Prepare building interiors for defense
   - Create internal passageways
   - Construct loopholes and bunkers
   - Enable interior battle capability

2. Sensor Integration
   - Extensive use of sensors/cameras
   - Reduce need for vulnerable sentries
   - Maintain constant surveillance
   - Enable rapid response

## Common Errors

1. Over-reliance on single concealment method
2. Inadequate sensor coverage
3. Poor deception plan integration
4. Insufficient interior preparation

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban defensive operations
- Supports deception operations
- Enables surprise attacks

## Training Considerations

1. Advanced camouflage techniques
2. Sensor system integration
3. Interior fortification methods
4. Blind engagement procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for concealment planning
- Essential for sensor integration
- Key for engagement prediction
- Important for deception modeling
