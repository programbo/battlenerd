# Wedge Formation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open to Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations

## Tactical Definition

The Wedge Formation is one of the most common Olvanan tactical formations,
employed when the direction of enemy engagement is not known along the axis of
advance. Similar to the Vee formation but with a more compact frontage,
traditional team structures are removed to provide greater centralized control
to the commander.

## Implementation

### Basic Organization

1. Forward Elements

   - Rifleman and grenadier lead from front point
   - Forward scanning of assigned arcs
   - Squad commander positioned behind point
   - Provides navigation and control
   - Maintains tactical flexibility
   - Enables rapid deployment
   - Supports immediate action drills

2. Flank Elements
   - Both Machine Guns (MG) employed on flanks
   - Maximum firepower forward and to flanks
   - Second-in-Command (2IC) provides command support
   - Enables rapid response to contact
   - Maintains formation security
   - Supports mutual fire
   - Facilitates all-round defense

### Movement Considerations
