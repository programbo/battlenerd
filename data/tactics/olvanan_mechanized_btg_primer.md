# Olvanan Mechanized Brigade Task Group Tactics Primer

## Classification

OFFICIAL v1.1.1

## Background

This document is based on two main US Army Training and Doctrine Command
documents:

- TC 7-100.2 OPFOR Tactics
- ATP 7-100.3 Chinese Tactics

The primer provides guidance on how an Olvanan Mechanised Brigade Tactical Group
(BTG) conducts offensive and defensive operations, based predominantly on ATP
7-100.3, using TC 7-100.2 to fill tactical gaps. It aims to provide a more
nuanced adversary rather than generic OPFOR.

   - Target vulnerable enemy components
   - Emphasize system over individual fighters

2. Battalion Focus
   - BDET as basic building block
   - BTG as flexible task organization
   - Less tailoring at battalion level
   - More customization at brigade level

### Operating Principles

1. Physical Isolation

   - Isolate enemy forces
   - Defeat in detail
   - Create numerical/firepower overmatch

2. Communication Disruption
