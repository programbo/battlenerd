**FOREWORD**

```
NOTE TO EXECISE DESIGNERS AND TRAINEES ON THE USE OF THE
OPERATION STEEL SENTINEL DOCUMENT SUITE
```

1. This Foreword provides guidance and advice on the use of the OP STEEL
   SENTINEL (OSS) suite of documents. OSS is written with a focus on collective
   training from Section level (or Service equivalent) all the way to a Joint
   Task Force Headquarters. The intent of OSS is to enable Joint or
   Joint-enabled training, encompassing the full spectrum of military operations
   across all domains (maritime, land, air, space and cyber/information).
2. The OSS documents are designed to provide an overall narrative for a
   fictitious conflict in Australia’s near region. OSS utilises the Decisive
   Action Training Environment (DATE) as the vehicle to enable training and the
   repository of information regarding the Operational Environment (OE). All
   DATE specific OE information can be found in the following link (recommend
   using Chrome):

https://odin.tradoc.army.mil/

3. Note that OSS utilises country boundaries within DATE that may have changed
   on ODIN post publication of the OSS suite of documents. For reference, OSS
   will continue to use the country boundaries shown in Figure 1 below.

```
Figure 1. DATE-P OSS JFAO and Country Boundaries
```

4. The overall theme in designing OSS is to provide a narrative (General Idea)
   that enables the development of scenarios for a given training objective
   (Special Idea). The design philosophy for OSS is **_Descriptive_** not
   **_Prescriptive_**. Exercise designers are free to change any of the
   variables within OSS to suit the needs of the training audience. The OSS
   suite of

documentation merely ‘sets the board’ for the training audience to be exercised.
There is no requirement for exercise designers to follow the Campaign Plan as
described and may change the conditions for each phase to meet the training
objectives.

5. The variables that can be changed include (but are not limited to):

```
a. OPFOR composition/equipment/location and start state during each phase
```

```
b. BLUFOR composition and C2 arrangements
```

```
c. PMESII variables to suit real-world locations (e.g. changing city/town names
to reflect local training area geography)
```

```
d. Campaign Plan execution
```

6. Additionally, exercise designers can change the geography of the contested
   JFAO to suit their local conditions. For example, the island of Panay can be
   placed anywhere in Australia with the other islands of Belesia placed in
   accordance to where other training areas are located. Similarly, the island
   of Panay can be as large or as small as the exercise needs it to be.
7. Finally, the suite of documents for OSS is by no means complete. If exercise
   designers require more information or assistance in the development of
   further training material to enable the use of OSS, please contact the
   Training Adversary Systems Support Cell (TASSC), at HQ FORCOMD through the
   following email:

**Time Zone Used Throughout the OPORD: ZULU.**

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. Growing ethnic tensions in the Belesian island of Panay resulted
in violence when the local government in Panay attempted to take control of the
lucrative Cerium rare earth mine in San Rafael from the Olvanan registered
operator. The resulting loss of life amongst the Belesian Constabulary and
unknown number of mine employees has sparked unrest in the nearby city of Roxas
with the violence occurring along ethnic lines with the greatest loss of life
amongst the Torbian diaspora. Olvana (OV) and North Torbia (NT) have been
conducting a week’s long biennial exercise in the South China Sea, named
Exercise RISEN SWORD. It was under the cover of this exercise that NT landed a
marine force (estimated to be a Brigade) on Palawan near the sparsely populated
town of El Nido, capturing the port and airfield facilities. Simultaneously, NT
landed a Marine Expeditionary Brigade near the city of Roxas, Panay and captured
the seaport, airport, and the San Rafael Mine. NT has claimed the justification
for this act of aggression is to protect ethnic Torbians in Panay from
persecution. In response to this blatant disregard for international protocols,
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed UNSCR 8868 (ref A) condemning
NT aggression and calling for the withdrawal of NT Forces from Belesian
territory. Concurrently, Belesia (BX) landed a Brigade of troops in the south of
Panay through the city of Iloilo in an attempt to force the NT forces off the
island. This course of action has resulted in a stalemate with the NT Marine
Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) holding the northern half of Panay centred on the
city of Roxas and the BX Forces holding the area around the city of Iloilo. NT
has since declared a Maritime Exclusion Zone (MEZ) and Air Defence
Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the occupied islands and parts of the Sulu and
South China Sea.

In an effort to allow diplomatic options to be utilised and reduce further loss
of life, the UNSC passed UNSCR 8869 (ref B) calling on all Member States to
enforce economic and military sanctions against NT. With NT’s continued
occupation of Panay and Palawan in contravention of International laws, the UNSC
passed UNSCR 8873 authorising the raising of the International Belesian Security
Assistance Force (IBSAF) to utilise military force to remove NT military
elements on sovereign Belesian territory. Australia has volunteered to be the
lead nation of the Combined Joint Task Force 667 (CJTF 667) with contributing
nations including New Zealand, Fiji, Malaysia, Singapore, Tonga, PNG, Japan and
Thailand. The Government of BX has consented, subject to SOFAs (ref D), to allow
CJTF 667 forces to stage through their territories, to station forces, materiel
and installations involved in supporting its operations and to overflights.

b. Strategic Aim. The aim of the international community is to:

```
(1) end North Torbian aggression towards Belesia
(2) expel all North Torbian military forces from Belesian sovereign territory
(3) create a free, safe, secure and stable environment in the region
(4) facilitate the continuation of Belesian democratic national governance and
developmental programs.
```

c. Strategic Objectives. In order to achieve the desired end state, the
strategic objectives of the international intervention include:

```
(1) Expel all North Torbian military forces from Belesian sovereign territory.
(2) Restore a secure and stable environment throughout the BX Joint Force Area of
Operations (JFAO).
(3) Effect force protection for coalition military forces deployed throughout the JFAO.
(4) Assist the government of BX to strengthen the capacities of their national security
forces and institutions to enforce central control.
(5) Preserve and enforce the freedom of navigation throughout the JFAO.
(6) Support UN Agencies, International Organizations (IOs) and NGOs within capabilities
and limitations in order to preserve human life and alleviate the suffering of IDPs and
refugees within the JFAO.
(7) Gradually reduce the size, role and profile of the IBSAF contribution. This process
will be guided by reviews of tasks, environment, threat, risks, follow-on forces and
Host Nation (HN) capacities as part of a Transition and Exit Strategy that is linked to
the achievement of the Desired Military Strategic End State.
```

d. CJTF Center of Gravity. The operational center of gravity is assessed as the
CJTF offensive air capability, which allows CJTF to achieve air superiority over
the JFAO and degrade North Torbian forces to the required level to allow
maritime and ground operations to occur.

```

```

e. Operational Objectives. With the support and agreement of the international
community, IBSAF has undertaken to end the crisis in BX by deploying a combined
joint task force to BX to repel NT invading forces and restore BX territorial
sovereignty. The force, hereafter referred to as the Combined Joint Task Force
667 (CJTF 667) will deploy under the authority of UNSCR 8873 (ref C). The
objectives of this military intervention are as follows:

```
(1) Establish military superiority in the maritime and airspace within the JFAO in a
manner which supports decisive operations.
(2) Conduct decisive military operations, which leads to the restoration of Belesian
sovereignty in the occupied islands; stabilize the region; and deter further external
aggression against BX.
(3) Assist humanitarian assistance efforts and IO/NGO activities in BX.
(4) Assist the government of BX to re-establish and maintain a safe and secure
environment to facilitate the continuance of democratic government institutions and
programmes.
(5) Support any applicable International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations of crimes
against humanity through the preservation and collection of evidence.
```

f. Desired Operational End State. The Desired End State remains the
establishment of a sufficiently secure and stable environment in the occupied BX
islands and improved capability of BX security forces such that state-sponsored
hostilities have ceased, territorial borders are secure, humanitarian assistance
programs operate unhindered and transition to a UN-sanctioned and/or HN
follow-on security force is complete. A safe and secure environment in BX exists
when:

```
(1) It allows IOs and NGOs safe and unrestricted access to the BX population.
(2) It encourages the return of IDPs and refugees.
(3) It fosters the rapid re-establishment of representative government institutions.
(4) It allows economic reconstruction and development.
```

g. Limitations.

```
(1) Constraints. In conducting its operations, CJTF 667 will:
A. Minimize the use of scarce BX resources.
B. Minimize collateral damage and civilian casualties in BX.
C. Deploy to the JFAO as soon possible in a sequence coordinated by this
headquarters.
D. Work closely with the UN to facilitate the work of UN agencies, IOs and NGOs.
E. Minimize the demand on BX resources.
F. Operate in accordance with the SOFA with BX (r ef D).
```

```

```
(2) Restraints. In conducting its operations, CJTF 667 will not:
A. Disrupt the use of civilian air routes in and out of areas outside of the JFAO.
B. Adversely effect the BX economy more than is necessary.
C. Disrupt maritime traffic in the region outside of the JFAO.
```

h. Operational Areas.

```
(1) JFAO. The JFAO includes the landmasses, national air space and territorial waters of
BX and the waters and associated airspaces of the Sulu Sea, the Celebes Sea north of
the XX degrees latitude, Philippine Sea west of XX degrees longitude and the South
China Sea east of XX degrees longitude.
(2) CFLCC Area of Operations (AO). The CFLCC AO is comprised of the landmass,
airspace and territorial waters (12NM) of Panay and Palawan Islands.
```

i. Threat Assessment. See Annex B, as well as the Country Studies at References
E to I inclusive for more detail.

```
(1) General. The Pacific region encompassing the countries of North Torbia (NT), South
Torbia (RT), Belesia (BX), Gabal (GX) and Olvana (OV) have been involved with a
tense game of power since the end of European colonisation. OV has aggressively
sought to impose its position as the regional hegemon, with expansion into recognised
international waters in the South China Sea. Similarly, nations such as RT, GX and
BX view the shift as an opportunity to grow their influence and develop their
economic ties both in the region and with external partners. Control of critical mineral
and fishing resources, manufacturing, and unfettered transport of goods in the region’s
shipping lanes is a key point of tension for all. The border between NT and RT has
been a historical flash point with both nations involved in a recent border clash that
has resulted in an uneasy armistice. Within the states of the region, groups that had
previously seen no opportunity for influence view the instability as a path to develop
their voices. Internal conflict within each state is a persistent and potentially
destabilising factor as government’s position for legitimacy and consolidate their
power.
(2) Country of BX. The Federated States of Belesia is a relatively new democracy in the
region. The turbulence of its independence from colonial rule continues to create
stability challenges throughout its many member-islands. Political turmoil, popular
unrest, and widespread terrorism combine to create a volatile environment for this
young federation. One of the few stabilising factors is the development of economic
opportunities and trade, in particular the exploitation of BX’s rich natural resources.
Despite progress in this area, sufficient infrastructure and business processes have yet
to be developed, hampering the further BX progress. The most significant
development of the Belesian Federation Defense Force is the fomalisation and
aggregation of member islands’ inconsistent security efforts. This standardisation and
professionalism is most evident in the establishment of a national constabulary and a
national guard. Maintaining a balance between enforcing nationhood and preserving a
degree of local autonomy has been the major challenge to national policy
implementation and military stationing efforts.

(3) Country of NT. The Democratic People’s Republic of Torbia, also called North
Torbia, is one of the most militarised countries in the world, with more than half a
million active duty military personnel and over two million reservists. NT’s military
spending is around 20% of its GDP, and about one-quarter of all adults serve in some
military capacity. NT is a single-party, despotic state that occupies the northern half of
the Island of Luzon. It is self-described as a ‘self-reliant socialist republic’, but its
structure is deeply totalitarian, wholly reliant on a cult-of personality and militarism
for survival.
```

```

k. International Organizations (IOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Some IOs and NGOs are currently operating in BX. Their presence is expected to
increase dramatically once a more secure operating environment is created. See
Annex Q for further details.

l. National Command Elements (NCE). Each troop-contributing nation (TCN) may
deploy a NCE to manage national command issues. All NCEs will remain undeclared
but it is anticipated that they will collocate with HQ CJTF 667, in terrain to
be allocated by this HQ.

m. National Support Elements (NSE). Each TCN may deploy an NSE or equivalent
capability. The headquarters of those elements will be located in General Santos
City, collocated with the HQ of the JFLOGCC. JFLOGCC will retain coordinating
authority over all NSEs.

n. Reserves. Each TCN has been requested to be prepared to consider requests for
additional forces should the need arise. Specific forces have not been earmarked
and the deployment time is estimated at 90-120 days.

o. BX. BX has agreed to act as the HN to support the deployment and staging of
CJTF 667.

p. Rotation of Forces. The timeframe for OSS is situation dependent. The initial
operating mandate provided by the UN is of 12 months duration, with extensions
as required. The initial force deployment is to be for XX months. TCNs may plan
for the rotation of forces after that period of time.

2. **Mission.** CJTF 667 conducts military operations to expel all NT forces
   from Belesian sovereign territory in order to create conditions for the
   re-establishment of a safe and secure environment in Belesia and the
   surrounding region.

3. **Execution.**

a. Commander’s Analysis. The occupation of Belesian sovereign territory and the
subjugation of Belesian citizens by the North Torbian military is an
unacceptable act of aggression and will not be tolerated by the international
community. This act of aggression flies in the face of international norms. To
that end, the UNSC have given IBSAF (CJTF 667) the mandate to end NT occupation
of BX territory and to restore the rule of law. CJTF 667 must act with resolve
in meeting this UN mandate. To date, this conflict has remained localised
between NT and BX. However, all subordinate commanders must understand that
antagonising other neutral regional countries through unrestricted use of force
can escalate into a wider conflict. It is important that our actions are
conducted within international guidelines and that care to reduce collateral
death and damage to non-combatants is utmost in all planning considerations.
Subordinate commanders at all levels must be alert to these factors in the
conduct of all of their operations, particularly as we transition from combat
operations. Having said this, CJTF 667 must act in a manner which permits the
rapid return to a stable economic environment, with minimal negative impact on
the strategic infrastructure of BX.

b. Commander’s Intent. The BX Military is a capable force that has the capacity
to deal with the NT aggression effectively. However, internal politics and the
unstable nature of government institutions in this young nation has meant that
they have called for international assistance to dealing with NT aggression.
Additionally, historic ethnic tensions between BX central authority and the
various ethnic groups in the occupied territories means that BX is not able to
utilise their capable military to deal with NT aggression effectively. UNSCR
8869 authorised the embargo of arms and materiel to NT. Despite the arms
embargo, IBSAF does not have the authority to enforce the embargo and it is
arguable that enforcing the embargo without Olvanan cooperation would be
impossible. CJFT667 will utilise all forces within its command to meet the UNSCR
8873 goal of removing NT military presence in BX and establishing a safe and
secure environment for the transition of authority back to BX. OSS will be a
five-phase operation to meet the strategic objectives of UNSCR 8873. During all
Phases CJTF 667 will be prepared to use appropriate force as required, but
applied with precision and being cognizant of the need to reduce collateral
damage. Phase 0 will consist of shaping operations to begin isolating
politically, economically and socially the NT forces. Phase 1 will see the
commencement of physically isolating the NT forces and degrading their
capability in BX. Phase 2 will see the conduct of Joint Force Entry Operations.
Phase 3 will begin with the decisive close combat land operations. Phase 4 will
be the transition of authority to the UN and BX. At all times, we must be
cognisant that the main effort is the removal of NT forces in BX. If this can be
achieved during any of the stages without further bloodshed, then all effort
must be taken to explore those options. All CJTF 667 Units must be prepared to
transition to all phases with minimal warning. The end state is a smooth
transfer of CJTF 667 responsibilities to a designated follow-on force/authority,
with CJTF 667 forces returned to national control.

c. Main Effort. The main effort is the restoration of Belesian territorial
sovereignty to a peaceful and stable environment.

G. Phase I operations to commence not before XXXXXX.
H. D Day- commencement of Phase II operations.
I. R Day – Redeployment of CJTF 667 forces begins.
(2) Transfer of Authority.
A. BX Forces. BX’s SHC will continue to command defensive operations until
declaration of CJTF 667 OPRED (most probably coincident with JFACC
OPRED). At that time, designated BX maritime, land and air combat forces will
TOA OPCON to CJTF 667 for Phase 1 operations.
B. JFACC. On declaration of JFACC HQ OPRED, it will assume ACC
responsibilities for the Belesian Supreme High Command (SHC) with OPCON of
both deterrent early deployed AS assets and designated BX Air Force aircraft.
When HQ CJTF 667 is declared OPRED, ACC will revert back to the CJTF.
C. Troop Contributing Nations. TCNs will deploy forces to the JFAO under national
command arrangements but in coordination with JFLOGCC staff and the
respective component command. On arrival in the JFAO and declared OPRED by
respective National Commanders maritime, land, air and SOF forces will be
transferred OPCON to CJTF 667 and subsequently to their component commands.
D. Sustainment Forces. Undeclared Combat Service Support resources that are not
transferred OPCON as part of the combat force will be transferred TACON to
JFLOGCC for space allocation, movement control, local defense and
coordination. NSEs will remain under national command while deployed in BX
but JFLOGCC will have coordinating authority over NSE.
(3) PWs and Captured Persons (CPERS). Handling and disposition of PWs and CPERS
will be in accordance with Appx 1 to Annex L. AS has agreed to be Lead Nation on
the handling and disposition of PW and CPERS.
A. National Responsibilities on PW/CPERS. For reasons of National sensitivity and
ownership of processes relating to PW/CPERS, all Coalition personnel will
respect their own national procedures following guidelines in accordance with the
Geneva Convention:
```

```
Page 16 of 20
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
B. Custody of PW/CPERS. PW/CPERS operations are a National responsibility. As
such, it is imperative that all persons detained by Coalition personnel remain in
the care and custody of authorized personnel only. It is understood that
operational requirements may force acceptance of PW/CPERS from, or transfer
to, other Allied nations of the Coalition. This shall be the exception and not the
norm. Should such circumstance become necessary, only the respective National
Commander or his designated representative can authorize the acceptance or
transfer of a PW/CPERS to or from another nation.
C. Treatment. PW and CPERS are to be treated in accordance with all accepted
international laws and conventions.
D. Transfer or Release. Although tactical situations may oblige commanders to
detain persons during the conduct of operations, it is the responsibility of National
Commanders at all levels to determine who will be categorised as a CPERS and
immediately field release all others. Once a determination has been made to
further retain the detained person and a PW/CPERS number has been assigned,
only the National Commander of the capturing nation has the authority to release
or transfer PW/CPERS to other nations. For the specific purpose of an individual
clearly detained as a PW, there is no requirement to determine status upon
capture, as PW are captured enemy combatants and remain in detention for the
duration of hostilities. The detaining power has an obligation to make a
determination of PW versus other CPERS status as soon as practical after capture.
E. PW and CPERS Reporting. In accordance with national directives, all PW or
CPERS in Coalition custody shall be reported via official means by using a
PW/CPERS Capture Report.
F. PW/CPERS Holding Facilities. All subordinate temporary holding facilities shall
be identified and reported to the CJTF 667 Provost Marshall. Holding facilities
are considered to be semi-permanent facilities used to process PW or CPERS and
include formation and unit level Holding Areas and Collection Points. The
following facilities will also be established:
```

1. CJTF 667 PW/CPERS Theatre Detention Facilities. AS will establish a PW/CPERS
   Theatre Detention Facility (TDF) Panay and Palawan PW/CPERS captured in the
   territory of BX.
2. National Collection Points/Holding Areas. These facilities will be
   established to facilitate the rearward passage of PW/CPERS in custody of the
   various nations. Nations will advise CJTF 667 of their respective locations.
   Nations will keep CPERS at collection points and holding areas only as long
   as circumstances require based on security/operational conditions, national
   policies and available transportation.

(4) Reports and Returns. The Battle Rhythm schedule for Reports and Returns will
be published once the HQ CJTF 667 has declared OPRED.

```

```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

4. **Admin and Logistics (Sustainment).**

a. Outline Concept.

```
(1) Sustainment support to CJTF 6674 will be coordinated and led by JFLOGCC. While
TCNs retain overall responsibility for the sustainment of national formations and units,
JFLOGCC retains coordinating authority.
(2) JFLOGCC will establish a Theater Support Area (TSA) within BX (Gen Santos City)
in order to execute sustainment operations. Additional logistic nodes will also be setup
in Zamboanga. Sustainment support during Ph 2-4 to forward FE will be the
responsibility of organic logistic FE through JFLOGCC coordination. Annex R will
provide more details.
(3) CJTF 667 will draw additional logistic support from National Support Base (NSB)
elements from AS, principally Joint Logistics Unit – North (JLU-N), Darwin.
(4) TCN should aim to establish in-theater op-stocks sufficient for 30 days, by the
completion of Phase 0 (Shaping). AS will act as lead nation for fuel and water and
may utilise contractor support from BX.
(5) Component command logistic staffs are responsible for their own logistics plans and
co-ordination.
```

b. Movements. JFLOGCC will coordinate all deployments into BX. Movement forward
into Panay and Palawan during Ph 3 will be coordinated by JFLCC HQ.

c. Medical Support. The concept of Health Support (HS) is detailed within the
Health Support Order at Annex AA. HS to CJTF 667 will be provided by ADF and
Coalition medical capabilities coordinated by the CJTF 667 J07. HQJOC J07
retains overall technical control (TECHON) for all health care delivery on an
overseas operation. While TCN will deploy with limited integral HS and retain
responsibility for definitive care of their troops, provision of deployed HS to
Coalition and HN personnel may occur IAW the Medical Rules of Eligibility
(MEDROE) detailed in the HSO.

```
(1) Role 1 HS will be provided by ADF and Coalition integral capabilities.
(2) Role 2 and Role 2 (Enhanced) HS will be provided on an area support basis with the
deployment of up to two R2E capabilities (from 17 Bde and RAAF – 1 EHS) scalable
dependent on phase and expected dependency (with an option for Maritime R2E with
the ATG).
(3) Role 3 HS will be provided by the NSB (Royal Darwin Hospital or other civilian
facility) or the USNS Mercy, which will be determined and coordinated by CJTF 667
J07.
```

highly dependent upon the flexible and interoperable CIS between Components and
contributing nations.

```
(1) CJTF 667 Sig Bn will:
A. Establish force level CIS down to Component HQs, including the management of
network interface gateways.
B. Coordinate theatre-wide CIS plans.
C. Perform theatre spectrum management.
(2) CJTF 667 CIS will provide secure voice, VTC and Coalition WAN (based on NATO-
CENTRIXS) to provide secure email, chat and other C3 tools down to Naval Task
Group/Bde/Wing level. Requests for extension of coalition CIS in support of national,
component or other requirements will be coordinated through the CJTF 667 J6 and
funded as appropriate.
(3) Component commands will provide the primary CIS and command support within
respective Component HQs.
(4) Use of HN communication infrastructure to supplement military networks will be
coordinated by HQ CJTF 667 J6, but contracted independently by TCN.
(5) TCN are responsible for national CIS communications to NCEs and NSEs, and within
national contingents.
```

(6) Network Operations.
A. Defensive Measures. CJTF 667 networks are targets for Computer Network
Attack (CNA) by enemy seeking to sabotage or exploit coalition information or
services. The primary vulnerabilities are through gateways with external systems
and inadvertent transfer of viruses from open systems. All contributing nations are
responsible for effective COMSEC and Computer Network Defence (CND) on all
national networks and systems; these measures are vital for effective C2 and the
maintenance of information dominance. CJTF 667 J6 is responsible for the
coordination of defensive measures and COMSEC for all CJTF 667 systems
through the Network Operations Center located with HQ CJTF 667 (deployed).
B. Offensive Measures Offensive network operations or Computer Network Attack
(CNA) will not be conducted by coalition partners against adversary networks
without approval of COMD CJTF 667.

**INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT PLAN**

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: Zulu.**

1. **Situation**

a. Characteristics of the Operational Environment (OE).

```
(1) See Appendix 6 and ODIN.
```

b. Enemy.

```
(1) Under the stated aim of “liberating ethnic Torbians from the oppressive governance of
the Belesian government”, North Torbia (NT) invaded the Belesian (BX) islands of
Palawan and Panay with the NT Marine Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) landing on
Palawan on ( insert date ) and Panay on (insert date). The NTMEF utilised the cover of a
biennial exercise with Olvana (Ex RISEN SWORD) to muster forces to commence their
OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, the annexation of Panay. The first phase of OP
RIGHTEOUS HARMONY saw the landing of NTMEF elements to capture an old
airfield and seaport in the north Palawan town of El Nido. Utilising El Nido as a logistic
staging base, within 24hrs NT landed (utilising amphibious and heli-borne troops) and
captured the seaport, airport and other key locations of the northern Panayan city of
Roxas. Roxas was the scene a few months earlier of rioting, which resulted in the deaths
of over one hundred ethnic Torbians. Little effective resistance was encountered during
the capture of El Nido and Roxas. It is estimated that the NTMEF has landed a Marine
Brigade (4th Marine Bde) in El Nido and established a logistic node to support
operations on Panay. The NTMEF HQ is also identified to have setup in El Nido to
better coordinate C2 and sustainment operations. The NTMEF is estimated to have
landed a reinforced Marine Brigade (3rd Marine Bde) in Panay. Shortly after taking
control of Roxas, the 3rd Marine Bde has advanced south and established a defensive
line approximately 40km south of Roxas. Conveniently, this defensive line incorporates
the San Rafael Mine complex, a key strategic asset in Panay that produces a large
quantity of rare earth metals, notably Cerium.
(2) In response to the capture of Roxas, the Belesian Federation Defence Forces (BFDF)
landed a Brigade (12th Infantry Bde) in the southern Panayan city of Iloilo. The 12th Bde
is a light infantry unit with minimal motorisation, so could be deployed at a relatively
short notice. However, the 12 Bde does not have the combat power to defeat the
NTMEF 3rd Marine Bde. Initial advances north from Iloilo by the BFDF 12th Bde was
stopped short of the NTMEF defensive line and has since resulted in a stalemate with
the majority of the 12th Bde holding defensive positions around Iloilo to secure the sea
and airport.
(3) The NTMEF has declared a Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) over northern Palawan, half of
Panay and the sea and air lanes connecting the two islands. The NTMEF has reinforced
their hold in Palawan and Panay with SU-30MKK fighter-bombers, and J-11B fighters,
along with active patrolling in the Sulu Sea between Palawan and Panay. Aside from
organic elements within the two NTMEF Marine Brigades, there have been reports of
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
HQ-16 SAMs, 122mm MLR batteries and other NTMEF Division troops in El Nido and
Roxas. It appears that not all NT Marine Expeditionary Division elements have been
deployed to Palawan or Panay. The remaining two Marine Brigades are reported to still
be in North Torbia and it is estimated that the NT armed forces do not want to escalate
this conflict wider. These two Marine Brigades may also be kept back as a strategic
reserve to reinforce the deployed Marine Brigades as required. Identified NT Naval
elements patrolling the sea-lanes within the declared TEZ include 1x Type 052D
(Luyang III) destroyer, 2x Type 052C (Luyang II) destroyers, 1x Type 051G (Luda)
destroyer, 2x Type 054A (Jiangkai II) frigates, 1x Type 053H3 (Jiangwei II) frigate, and
2x Type 053 (Jianghu V) frigates. Whilst not observed, it is assessed that an unknown
number of up to three Yuan and Song class diesel-electric submarines (SSG) are
operating in and around the sea-lanes between Palawan and Panay. Combat Air Patrols
of fighter aircraft have been observed operating out of El Nido and Roxas in addition to
rotary wing traffic of Z9 helicopters.
```

(4) Overall, the NTMEF are well trained and capable of conducting combined arms
and joint operations and are capable of limited power projection in the region.
The land forces of the NTMEF is designed for quick deployment and are therefore
lacking in heavier armour, but makes up for this deficiency in a larger number
of combat units within each Marine Brigade. It is expected that the 3rd Marine
Brigade in Panay will have been augmented with additional Divisional troops such
as an MRL Battery, an HQ-16 SAM AD Battery and significant Engineer troops.
Similarly, the NTMEF maritime and air capabilities are also significant and
capable with several platforms of Tier 1 or 2 capability (<15 years old).
Additionally, all NTMEF assets are under a unified command similar to a JTF
based on the Marine Division HQ. It is noted that NT has significantly more
forces on the mainland, but is postured along the North and South Torbian
border. NT sees a conflict with South Torbia (RT) as the more dangerous
possibility and will keep the bulk of its forces poised for a possible RT attack
(from their viewpoint). Consequently, we can expect that NT’s considerable
strike capabilities on the mainland will not be utilised in the conflict in BX
as they are held in reserve for a possible RT attack.

(5) Enemy Strengths

```
(a) General. NT maintains the second largest military of the five Pacific countries, only
behind Olvana. Militarily, it is a dominant actor within the region, capable of
conducting military action across the spectrum of operations. The NT military
conducts overt, covert, and clandestine operations with ripple effects across the
region. Reporting also suggests ties between elements of NT’s military and criminal
and terror groups within the region, which further extends the potential for a global
threat.
(b) Army. The Torbian People’s Army (TPA) is the largest and most influential of the
NT Armed Forces. With compulsory national service, the TPA has a large number
of military trained personnel from which to draw upon. This reflects the stated
nature of the TPA goal as the reunification of the two Torbias. The bulk of the TPA
is located within the Southern and Northern Commands. The Western Command
has the only credible non-land based power projection capability through the NT
Marine Division. This Marine Division reflects the NT shift to power projection
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
and is therefore well equipped with Tier 1, 2 and 3 equipment. The Marine Division
is slightly different to other TPA Divisions in that it has more Mechanised Infantry
Battalions per Brigade (4 vs 3). However, this is offset by having lighter armoured
vehicles than their non-marine counterparts.
(c) Air Force. The Torbian Peoples Air Force (TPAF) is a capable organisation that is
able to strike any targets within the JFAO. The TPAF has two squadrons of TU-22
bombers that can reach any target within the JFAO. However, these assets are kept
in strategic reserve and are primarily postured to counter any attack by South
Torbia. Instead, for OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, two squadrons of J-11 fighters
and two squadrons of SU-30MKK fighter-bombers have been allocated to support
the NTMEF. Additional AEW&C, surveillance and tanker support is provided. One
squadron of J-11 and SU-30MKK is operating out of El Nido, with the other
squadrons operating out of the Roxas airport.
(d) Navy. In recent years, the Torbian Peoples Navy (TPN) has greatly expanded its
maritime capability. In order to project power and maintain logistic support, the
TPN has provided significant support to OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY. The focus
of the TPN in support of the NTMEF is to secure the sea-lanes in and around the
contested islands of Panay and Palawan. The single Luyang III destroyer assigned
to the NTMEF is a significant threat to all aircraft in the TEZ. The NTMEF also
recognises the importance of the Luyang III and has kept this ship in the South
China Sea to secure the link between NT and El Nido, but also out of harm’s way
from possible RT attack.
```

(6) Enemy Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities.

```
(a) Army. The terrain (tropical) of Panay and Palawan means that travel of armoured
vehicles is restricted and will tend to canalize ground forces along MSRs. The
availability of engineer assets to support maneuverability is limited within the
NTMEF. It is expected that the 3rd Marine Brigade will have limited engineer
support assets. This is alleviated somewhat with the amphibious and light armour
nature of the NTMEF. This light amphibious armour nature of the NTMEF will
mean that the use of heavy armour by friendly forces will provide overmatch in
most tactical situations.
(b) Air Force: In the event of full-scale combat engagement by modern air forces, the
TPAF would not be able to accomplish more than local air parity for a short period.
The TPAF ability to project force against NT’s neighbors is not only a source of
national prestige but represents a significant investment on the part of the National
Command Authority (NCA). The NT NCA is unlikely to risk more than a token
loss to a superior force. The training and equipment of the TPAF is below the level
of CJTF 667. Additionally, any strike aircraft from mainland NT will have to fly a
circuitous route along the South China Sea avoiding Sth Torbian (RT) airspace,
which will reduce their ability to dominate the TEZ. Instead, the TPAF will have to
rely on forces staged out of Palawan and Panay in order to maintain dominance
over the TEZ.
(c) Navy. The TPN has a relatively long line of communication from Panay, through
Palawan back to NT. The TPN ability to enforce the TEZ will be limited in the
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
relatively close waters of the north Sulu Sea. Being close to RT waters also means
that they will have concerns regarding RT naval vessels monitoring their
movements. Finally, the TPN has invested heavily in its naval vessels and will be
reluctant to expose these assets to complete loss. Hence, it is expected that their
most valuable naval surface vessels will likely remain in the South China Sea with
lower tiered vessels operating in the Sulu Sea (with the exception of their SSGs).
(7) Enemy Courses of Action (COAs)
(a) Most Likely Course of Action. The strategic goal of the NT occupation of Panay
and Palawan is for a political solution to foster Panayan independence under NT
sponsorship and not to escalate the conflict further. This means that at the strategic
level, NT will be careful not to portray itself as an occupying aggressor. It is likely
that NT will limit its military presence on Panay and Palawan to that of a Marine
Division and supporting maritime and air elements. It is highly unlikely that NT
will reinforce the Marine Brigade on Panay with additional ground elements but
holding enough combat power to deter or defeat any offensive attacks by Coalition
Forces. In the event of CF landing ground forces on Panay, the NTMEF will utilise
SPF and local insurgents to disrupt CJTF 667 activities before using maneuver to
defeat or cause attrition to CJTF elements. The NTMEF will continue to maintain
the TEZ with combat air patrols and surface warship patrols. They will remain in a
defensive posture until hostilities commence. Additionally, the NTMEF will likely
aim to cause attrition of CJTF 667 in order to force a diplomatic solution. The
NTMEF will use information warfare to discredit CJTF 667 and BX Defense
Forces, challenge the legitimacy the BX government, tell its “liberation of ethnic
Torbians” story and promote its claim to support Panayan independence.
(b) Most Dangerous Course of Action. The NTMEF will reinforce the ground forces on
Panay with an additional Marine Brigade (likely the 1st Marine Brigade as the 2nd is
currently under strength and on a lower readiness cycle). With that amount of
combat power, the NTMEF may be able to capture the southern city of Iloilo and
occupy the entire island of Panay. If Coalition Forces have been successful in
degrading NTMEF capability prior to ground operations, the NTMEF may commit
to capturing Iloilo with just the 3rd Marine Brigade or commit to attacking CJTF
667 ground forces before the Land Component can commence offensive operations
on Panay. The NTMEF will use information warfare to discredit CJTF 667 and BX
Defense Forces, challenge the legitimacy of the BX government, tell its “liberation
of ethnic Torbians” story and promote its claim to support Panayan independence.
```

c. Friendly Forces.

```
(1) Coalition Intelligence Capability. Coalition intelligence organizations, including those
nested within the CJTF will provide all-source intelligence utilising all possible means,
including the establishment of a Multi-National intelligence operations center that will
serve as a central all-source intelligence fusion center supporting operations in the
JFAO.
```

2. **Mission**

**UNCLASSIFIED**

a. Coalition intelligence conducts intelligence operations in order to enable
operations against NTMEF and affiliated groups in Panay and Palawan within the
JFAO.

3. **Execution**

a. Concept of Intelligence Operations. Coalition intelligence will conduct
intelligence support to operations to enhance Indications and Warning (I&W) and
situational awareness in the region. Intelligence support will focus along three
lines of effort to achieve objectives in BX. Priority Intelligence Requirements
(PIRs) will be modified to support emerging operations and will drive
intelligence operations during the execution of this plan.

b. Purpose. Coalition intelligence will support a long term, comprehensive
approach. Intelligence assessments must account for and connect all factors
within the political, military, economic, social, infrastructural, information,
physical environment and time domains (PMESII- PT) - and actors influencing the
dynamics in the JFAO and Area of Interest (AOI). The main priorities are to
provide threat I&W to Coalition forces, identify and exploit opportunities that
achieve optimal results against the enemy, and provide kinetic and non-kinetic
targeting information leading to mission success.

c. Method. Coalition intelligence capabilities organise and conduct intelligence
operations that drive collection, production and analysis, contributions to
target development, reporting, and collaboration with partners to provide timely
and actionable support to the CJTF while maintaining support to the Coalition’s
ongoing operations in the JFAO. In order to achieve this, the Coalition
intelligence architecture must synchronize and share information that produces
comprehensive intelligence assessments. Working with partner nations, the
Coalition will employ all intelligence capabilities and provide timely and
relevant intelligence in order to support operations. Three primary intelligence
Lines of Effort complement each other and remain constant throughout each phase
of the operation.

```
(1) Intelligence Lines of Effort (LOEs).
(a) Intelligence Line of Effort I – ISR and Collection. This line of effort focuses on
collection coordination of Coalition ISR capabilities across the JFAO. This LOE
seeks to synchronize the collection effort in order to satisfy operational and
intelligence requirements and continue to update and refine the operational
environment. LOE I monitors the JFAO and AOI for I&W, builds situational
awareness, supports targeting operations, and conducts battle damage assessments
(BDA).
(b) Intelligence Line of Effort II – Analysis and Production. This LOE is designed to
ensure a common comprehensive understanding of the operational environment and
to support kinetic and non-kinetic targeting operations within the JFAO. LOE II
focuses on multisource analysis encompassing PMESII-PT, which satisfies
operational, and intelligence requirements.
(c) Intelligence Line of Effort III – Information Sharing. LOE III enables a
comprehensive Coalition approach to defeat the NTMEF. This LOE seeks to ensure
information sharing to the maximum extent possible allowed or in accordance with
each partner nation’s perspective, national policies and laws. Information sharing is
critical to this effort and must be placed within key nodes of Coalition intelligence
enterprise.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

(2) Intelligence Phasing.

```
(a) Intelligence Support to CJTF 667. Intelligence support to CJTF 667 to defeat
NTMEF is tied to five operational phases. This section will identify the main
activities of intelligence support LOEs and integrate them into each respective
phase.
```

1. Phase 0 – Shaping. During this Phase, the main effort of intelligence
   operations will be to support ISR collection efforts. This phase will see the
   deployment of critical advance force operation assets along with the
   utilization of HUMINT, SIGINT and other intelligence gathering assets to
   confirm NTMEF force disposition and intent, and inform the targeting process.
   The intelligence effort will also support the CJTF main effort of non-kinetic
   shaping operations.
2. Phase 1 - Denial. This Phase will see the main effort of intelligence
   operations supporting kinetic effects against NTMEF high value targets.
   Intelligence operations will focus in supporting the targeting process and
   the analysis of information gathered through ISR assets to inform the
   commencement of Phase 2. Joint Coalition intelligence organizations will also
   provide support to kinetic and non-kinetic strikes.
3. Phase 2 – Lodgement. The main effort for intelligence operations during this
   phase will be to continue to analyse information from all sources to support
   the lodgement of ground forces into Panay. It is important that I&W for NTMEF
   movement and intent be closely monitored. This is a critical phase of
   operation, as failure to achieve lodgement into Panay will mean the overall
   failure of the mission. Joint intelligence assets will also support the CJTF
   deception plan of staging amphibious forces off Palawan to make the NTMEF
   believe the CJTF main effort is the recapture of Palawan.
4. Phase 3 - Neutralise. During this phase the main effort of the intelligence
   operations shifts to supporting the execution of CJTF offensive ground
   operations and the lodgment of ground forces in Palawan. As NTMEF ground
   forces are defeated in Panay and Palawan, the main effort will shift from
   direct action against the NTMEF to operations against indigenous hostile
   forces inside Panay and Palawan. Despite the main effort shift to supporting
   indigenous forces, intelligence support will still likely be required to
   support CJTF 667 and BX Defense Forces as they hold territory regained from
   the invading NTMEF. Intelligence support to targeting, I&W, ISR, and OE
   refinement will continue throughout this phase as well.
5. Phase 4 - Transition. During this phase, the main effort conducts continuing
   ISR operations in order to monitor the situation and identify threats towards
   a safe and secure environment.

(3) Intelligence Tasks.

```
(a) Common Tasks to Coalition Intelligence Organizations.
```

1. Allocate resources and funding to support intelligence operations specified
   in the base plan.

    against enemy threats to include Advise and Assist (AA), Build Partner
    Capacity (BPC), and engagement (OAAs) missions.
12. Identify shortfalls to improve existing intelligence organization,
    architecture and procedures to optimize collaboration and synchronize
    orientation, collection, rapid fusion, and timely dissemination of
    intelligence.
13. Submit and process intelligence requirements throughout the implementation
    of this plan for intelligence needs and support to planning.
14. Task and synchronize ISR collection assets to satisfy Priority Intelligence
    Requirements (PIRs).
15. Identify and recommend opportunities for Coalition intelligence exchanges
    and training to further develop and refine regional partner forces, as
    needed.
16. Support kinetic and non-kinetic targeting operations during appropriate
    phases of this plan.

(5) Intelligence Activities.
(a) Collection Management (CM). Collection activities will focus on the PIRs and
emerging intelligence gaps and will be conducted and deconflicted in accordance
with established national policies and procedures, and subsequently published CJTF
guidance. Each respective Coalition member will determine an appropriate level of
support for its respective theatre collection assets. Wherever possible, Coalition
intelligence will participate in collection management working group forums in
order to synchronize Coalition and ISR operations.
(b) Analysis and Production (A&P). Coalition intelligence will analyse, produce, and
provide current intelligence and assessments in support of PIRs and provide
collateral releasable products to other partners as required.
(c) Dissemination and Information Sharing. The Coalition will seek to allow greater
sharing of intelligence on a more regular basis; however, disclosure decisions must
be in accordance with each partner nation’s policies. Safeguarding of information
remains a responsibility of each Coalition member in order to prevent unauthorized
release.

### Land Effects (Panay)

- Vegetation
  - Thick jungle vegetation along the western side
  - Farmlands and sub-tropical forests along the lowlands
- Topography
  - Panay is bisected by the Central Panay Mountain Range close to the west
    coast - Highest peak is Mt Madia-as (2,117m)
  - There are may rivers with the longest being the Panay River
  - Most of the population is concentrated on the central and eastern part of
    the island (lowlands)
  - The eastern lowlands contain many farms (sugarcane and rice)
- Assessment
  - Heavy vehicles may be restricted in movement to MSR
  - Will require engineer support to traverse along lowland areas
    (create/reinforce bridges)
  - Wet season will restrict movement significantly

### Land Effects (Panay)

- Urban
  - Iloilo City (pop - 448,000) -

Provincial capital

- Roxas City (pop – 167,000)
- Logistical hubs
- See APOD/SPOD data for Panay
- Single railway linking Roxas and

Iloilo originally used for

sugarcane produce

transportation

- POL sites
- Infrastructure

### Space Effects

- GPS
  - GPS and GLONASS available throughout the region
- Comms

#### Weather Effects -

#### Belesia

- Two seasons: Wet and Dry
  - Dry season Dec – May
  - Wet Season Jun – Nov
- Region is susceptible to tropical typhoons

during the wet season

- Typhoons are regular and generally

occur during Jul to Oct

- On average Belesia is hit by 9

typhoons/year of varying strength

- Temperature is relatively constant all year

as expected in a tropical climate

### NTMEF Assessment

**NTMEF**

- C2 based on JTF construct – unified

command chain

- Well trained and equipped compared to the

rest of the TPA

- Main platforms are 5-20 years old
- Service in the NT Marine Division is seen as

prestigious and sought after

- Expect Officer Cadre to be well trained and

motivated

- NTMEF capabilities are comparable to

ADF

### Non-State Actors (Insurgents)

**Visayan Peoples Front (VSF)**

- Insurgent organisation based in Belesia

(approx. 300 active members)

- Committed to the establishment of an

independent entity composed of the islands

of Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol from the

Belesian Federation

- Predominantly a Christian organisation

seeking to create a Christian nation

- Has been active in aiding NTMEF in Panay to

achieve political goals

- Prominently aided the NTMEF in securing the San Rafael Mine
- Likely to actively oppose CF in region

### Non-State Actors (Insurgents)

**Free Sulu Movement (FSM)**

- Conglomeration of anti-federation and

independence factions on the Belesian

archipelago (approx. 200 active members)

- The group seeks to break free from the

alleged over reach of Belesian central

government

- Predominantly a secular organisation
- Has links to criminal organisations and will

commit criminal acts to support political

goals

- Is not know to be actively supporting the

NTMEF in either Panay or Palawan

- May oppose CF in region if CJTF mission

does not support political goals

### Non-State Actors (Criminal)

**Black Societies**

- Criminal networks based in Olvana but operating

```
across the Belesian archipelago (approx. 250
active members)
```

- This criminal network is normally a family affair,

```
with each family staying local to avoid conflict
with other groups
```

- This criminal network is involved in:
  - Armed Robbery
  - Racketeering
  - Smuggling
  - Narcotics Trafficking
  - Prostitution
  - Gambling
  - Contract Killings
- Will not likely be a threat to CF but may leverage

off CF presence in Belesia

### Non-State Actors (Criminal)

**Tantoco Cartel**

- Criminal cartel founded in South Torbia (approx.

950 active members)

- Operates across the region (even within Nth

Torbia)

- Involved in most criminal activities including:
  - Drug and Weapons Smuggling
  - Extortion
  - Motor Vehicle Theft
  - Illegal Gambling
  - Money Laundering
  - Counterfeiting
  - Contract Killing
  - Piracy
- Has clashed with Black Society network over territory
- Will not likely be a threat to CF but may leverage off CF

presence in Belesia

Assessed Enemy Critical Factors / Decisive Points

**Critical Factors**

- North Torbia will have long supply lines that cannot overfly South Torbian
  territory
  - This has necessitated the capture of a staging base in Palawan
  - Supply lines will have to traverse through international waters in the South
    China Sea and Sulu Sea
- NT JTF(Div) Command will be located in Palawan
  - Sizeable force will be located in Palawan to protect this vital logistic
    node (4thMarine Bde)
- The long supply lines from North Torbia to Panay mean that enemy lines of
  communication are

vulnerable to interdiction and disruption

- North Torbia is relying on local Panayan support to maintain legitimacy of
  invasion
  - North Torbia will foment Panayan dissatisfaction with Belesian Federation
    and spur independence movement

**Decisive Points**

- Reinforce the ground forces in Panay with an additional NTMEF Div troops
- Potential capture of Iloilo
- Set conditions for favourable political solution
- Set conditions for the independence of Panay (under North Torbian / Olvanan
  auspices) from Belesian

Federation by exploiting historical ethnic tensions

Assessed Enemy Centre of Gravity

**Strategic**

- North Torbia’s Strategic CoG is the moral narrative that their occupation of
  Belesian territory is to protect ethnic

Torbians from persecution in Belesiaand their ability to control and maintain
that narrative

**Operational**

- North Torbia’s ability to sustain projected power in the region
- Ability to control the sea/air lanes
- The physical manifestation of this CoG are:
  - Surface and sub-surface naval capability
  - Combat aircraft operating out of Palawan and Panay
  - Logistics node at Palawan

**Tactical**

- TBA

ANNEX C TO
CJTF 667 OPORD
DATED XXXXXX
```

```
C-1/24
```

### CJOPS Intent

- **Commander’s Intent**
  - **Purpose.** Enforce UNSCR 8873 to re-establish Belesian sovereignty in

Panay and Palawan

- **Method.** Deploy CJTF 667 with enablers from ADF and OGA to the JFAO

to prosecute Multi-Domain Operations against North Torbian elements

in Belesian sovereign territory. Coordinate WOAG and multinational

efforts to enforce UNSCR 8873

- **Endstate.** The removal of North Torbian forces from Belesian sovereign

territory, establishment of a safe and secure environment in the

occupied Belesian territories, and conditions set for the UN supervised

transition of authority in Panay and Palawan back to the Belesian

Government

```

```

```
C-2/24
```

### Critical Assumptions

- Critical Assumptions
  - CJTF 667 will be a single rotation deployment
  - Minimum mass of Defence capability must remain in AUS for national defence
  - CJTF 667 will include FE from other nations
  - Full SOFA and cooperation with Belesia to allow staging of Coalition Forces
    (CF) from Belesian territory
  - CJTF 667 will not have complete operational command of all Host Nations
    (Belesian) Forces within the AO - CJTF 667 will have Operational Control of
    designated Belesian Forces - Belesian Forces will only be involved in a
    defensive capacity
  - Olvana will remain neutral as long as CF does not threaten Olvanan interests
    in the region (e.g. no staging of CF out of South China Sea)
  - South Torbia will remain strictly neutral due to previous armistice with
    North Torbia and will vigorously defend its territory (incl EEZ) from ALL
    incursions
  - Gabal has no means of enforcing sovereign territory

b. Friendly Forces. Refer to Annex A (Task Organisation) and paragraph 1j
(Friendly Forces) to CJTF 667 OPORD (OPERATION STEEL SENTINEL), DTG.

2. **Mission**. JTF 667 assigned offensive fire support, EW, IO and targeting
   units are to deliver joint effects, lethal and non-lethal, in BX JFAO in
   order to isolate, contain and expel NTMEF.
3. **Execution**.

Commander’s Effects Intent:

```
Purpose. Reinforce, amplify and expand capacity of BX to expel NTMEF (NT) from BX
sovereign territory.
Method. The following Joint Effects will support the line of operation:
(a) Main Effort. Support the restoration of BX territorial sovereignty by applying
lethal and non-lethal joint offensive support and targeting capabilities.
(b) Supporting Effort s:
```

1. Intelligence-led Surveillance and Target Acquisition across JTFAO to identify
   high-vale (HVT) and high pay-off targets (HPT).
2. Application of kinetic and non-kinetic systems to priority HPT/HVT to deplete
   NTMEF in JTFAO leading to their explosion from BX sovereign territory.
3. Interdict sea/air lanes between NT and BX to isolate NTMEF.
4. Cyber Operations to deplete NT ICT operational and tactical ICT capability.
5. Information Operations to garner and maintain support for JTF operation to
   repel NT from BX sovereign Territory and fulfill requirements of UN
   Resolutions.
6. Establish protective operations to counter NTMEF efforts to prevent CJTF
   achievement of its mission. **End State.** CJTF 667 has established
   operational supremacy in JTFAO that friendly operations are able to expel
   NTMEF from BX sovereign territory and NTMEF cannot interfere with or
   operations.

```
I- 3/12
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

Guidance for Joint Effects. Employ lethal and non-lethal capabilities to achieve
prioritised effects that contribute directly to the achievement of strategic,
operational, and tactical objectives. NTMEF have established positions in
PALAWAN and PANAY requiring JTF 667 to fix NT forces in Phases 0 & 1. The
priority of effort in Phases 0 & 1 will be information operations, cyber
operations, maritime operations and air support operations. Phase 2 and beyond
will commence the incorporation of ground-based fire support in the joint
offensive fire support system. JFECC will be established and responsible for the
effective application of capability in the JTFAO.

```
Targets and priorities. CJTF will base deliberate and dynamic targeting plans on
CJOP’s Joint Integrated Prioritised Target List (JIPTL), which is based on the Strategic
Effects and Targeting Board Directive:
(a) Identify HVT/HPT and method of engagement:
```

1. Kinetic/Lethal;
2. Kinetic/Non-Lethal;
3. Non-Kinetic/Lethal; and
4. Non-Kinetic/Non-Lethal. (b) Indicate deliberate schedule and on-call target;
   (c) Designate:
5. Joint Target List;
6. No-Strike List; and
7. Restricted Target List. c. Concept of Operations. Refer to paragraph 3d,
   Concept of Operations, to CJTF 667 OPORD (OPERATION STEEL SENTINEL), DTG.

d. Concept of Joint Effects. The CJFT JFECC coordinates, synchronises, and
controls the employment of joint fires. Joint fires focus on NTMEF in JTFAO
affecting CJTF operations. Joint fires provide decisive effects against the
NTMEF, anything less is unacceptable. Initially, joint fires focus on shaping
operations to isolate NT forces in PALAWAN and PANAY from potential
reinforcement and sustainment, setting the conditions for the explosion of the
enemy. As clearance operations commence, joint fires strike deep into the NT’s
combat formations and command and control structure, this enhancing the sense of
isolation of forces on PALAWAN and PANAY. Use of NGS, ground-based systems and
offensive air support will require establishment of air superiority in the JFTAO
across all Phases, therefore SEAD will be a priority activity.

(1) Phase 0 - **Shaping** (a) Concept of Joint Effects. JTF 667 joint fire
support will shape the battlespace by degrading NTMEF on PALAWAN and PANAY by
isolating them from potential reinforcement and sustainment. The effort will be
focus of JFMCC and JFACC. SOTG will provide observation, communication and
liaison on PALAWAN and PANAY for joint fire support actions during this phase.

```
(b) Task. CFMCC and CFACC set the conditions for Phase 2 and beyond operations
through interdiction of NT LOC and depletion of NT operational capability on
```

```
I- 4/12
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
PALAWAN and PANAY. Joint fires initially isolate NT through defeat of their
operational-level command and control and disruption of lines of communication.
Maintain air superiority over JTF in BX gradually expanding to include areas in
PALAWAN and PANAY currently under NT control.
```

(c) Purpose. To set the conditions for successful JTF build p and operational
lodgements in JTFAO by depleting NT ability to establish in BX.

(d) Execution. JTF 667 JFECC will coordinate AI and maritime operations over sea
and air lanes between NT & BX. In addition, JFECC will coordinate STA and joint
offensive support to locate and attack HPT and HVT IAW Target Lists: C2, FIRES,
GBAD, aircraft and communication nodes on PALAWAN and PANAY. Employ J **-** SEAD
to support the expansion of air superiority over PALAWAN and PANAY currently
held by NT forces. IO focuses on convincing NT leadership that further
resistance is futile and to cease combat operations. IO garners and maintains
public support of JTF-OSS while continuing to undermine public support and
legitimacy of the NT. Priority of fires is the provision of offensive air
support and NGS. (e) Assessment. NT air defence destroyed, command and control
neutralised and ground-based fire support reduced to 50%. NT leadership wavering
in its resolve and incapable of providing responsive fires. NT unable to develop
its operations or interfere with ours. (f) Targeting Priorities.

1. Interdict sea and air LOC.
2. Neutralise NT C2 on PALAWAN and PANAY.
3. Destroy ground-based air defence on PALAWAN and PANAY.
4. Neutralise manoeuvre formations capable of interfering with amphibious
   lodgment sites. (g) JTF 667 Air Apportionment.

(2) Phase 1 – **Denial**.

```
(a) Concept of Joint Effects. JTF 667 joint fire support continue to shape the
battlespace by degrading NTMEF on PALAWAN and PANAY by isolating them
from potential reinforcement and sustainment as well as escalating actions on NT
targets on PANAY. The effort will be focus of JFMCC and JFACC. SOTG will
provide observation, communication and liaison on PALAWAN and PANAY for
joint fire support actions during this phase. Maintain air superiority over JTFAO
and begins to extend into PALAWAN and PANAY.
(b) Task. CFMCC and CFACC continue to set the conditions for Phase 2 and
beyond operations through interdiction of NT LOC and depletion of NT
operational capability on PALAWAN and PANAY. Joint fires initially isolate
NT through defeat of their operational-level C2 and disruption of lines of
communication. Maintain air superiority, extending to include areas in PANAY
currently under NT control.
(c) Purpose. Set the conditions for the destruction of NT as a fighting force.
(d) Execution. JTF 667 JFECC will coordinate STA and joint offensive support to
locate and attack HPT and HVT IAW Target List: C2, FIRES, GBAD, aircraft
and communication nodes in PALAWAN and PANAY. J - SEAD is employed to
support the expansion of air superiority over JTFAO currently held by NT
forces and, when able, to support AI operations over sea and air lanes between
NT & BX. IO focuses on convincing NT leadership that further resistance is
futile and to cease combat operations. IO garners and maintains public support
of JTF-OSS while continuing to undermine public support and legitimacy of the
NT. Priority of fires is the provision of offensive air support and NGS.
(e) Assessment. NT ground formations rendered combat ineffective. NT forces on
PALAWAN and PANAY isolated and disconnected from LOC from NT. Local
populace remains supportive of JTF 667 OSS and actions while resolve of NT
leadership continues to degrade.
(f) Targeting Priorities.
```

1. Neutralise NT C2 on PALAWAN and PANAY.
2. Destroy ground-based air defence on PALAWAN and PANAY.

6. CAS - 5%. (h) JFLCC CAS Distribution.
1. TG667.4
1. TG640. (3) Phase 2 – **Lodgement**. (a) Concept of Joint Effects. JTF 667
   joint fire support will focus on denying NT forces on PANAY from interfering
   with the disembarkation at ILOILO and the amphibious lodgment in SOUTHEASTERN
   area of PANAY. This is include neutralising all maritime, air and ground
   approaches to the lodgement sites. Joint effects are to ensure such supremacy
   in the battlespace that NT forces’ freedom of manoeuvre is denied and that
   JTF 667 freedom of manoeuvre is maximised. Effort will shift to CFLCC
   operations on PANAY and preparation for a lodgment IVO EL NIDO on PALAWAN.
   SOTG will provide observation, communication and liaison on PALAWAN and PANAY
   for joint fire support actions during this phase. CFACC maintain air
   superiority over PALAWAN and PANAY.

(b) Task. JTF 667 continue to set the conditions for Phase 3 and beyond
operations through destruction NT IOT deplete NT operational capability on
PALAWAN and PANAY. Joint fires initially deny NT ability to repel maritime and
amphibious lodgements on PANAy and PALAWAN through annihilation of armour, IDF
and anti-shipping capabilities. Continue to disrupt C2 and lines of
communication. Maintain air superiority over PANAY and PALAWAN.

(c) Purpose. Ensure successful lodgement on NT held islands in JFTAO and set the
conditions for a breakout from beachheads on PANAY and PALAWAN to defeat NT
forces.

(d) Execution. JTF 667 JFECC will coordinate STA and joint offensive support to
locate and attack HPT and HVT IAW Target List: C2, FIRES, armour, GBAD, aircraft
and communication nodes in PALAWAN and PANAY. J **-** SEAD is employed to
support the maintain air superiority over JTFAO currently held by NT forces and,
when able, to support AI operations over sea and air lanes between NT & BX. IO
focuses on convincing BX population in PANAY and PALAWAN that liberation from NT
is imminent to eliminate any support to NT. NT. Convince NT leadership that
further resistance is futile and to cease combat operations. Priority of fires
is the provision of offensive air support, IDF and NGS

(e) Assessment. NT ground formations rendered combat ineffective by the
destruction of armour and IDF systems. NT forces on PALAWAN and PANAY isolated
and disconnected from LOC from NT. Local populace remains supportive of JTF 667
OSS and actions while resolve of NT leadership continues to degrade.

```
(f) Targeting Priorities.
```

1. Destroy ground-based air defence on PALAWAN and PANAY
2. Neutralise NT ground, air and maritime capabilities to eliminate interference
   with amphibious lodgment sites, beachheads and breakout
3. Destroy NT armour on PALAWAN and PANAY

(4) Phase 3- **Neutralise**

```
(a) Concept of Joint Effects. JTF 667 joint fire support will incorporate ground-
based systems and continue to shape the battlespace by degrading NTMEF in
JTFAO. Effort is by isolating them from potential reinforcement and sustainment
as well as escalating actions on NT targets on PANAY and supporting
deception plan on PALAWAN. JFLCC and SOTG will provide observation,
communication and liaison on in JFTAO for joint fire support actions during this
phase.
(b) Task. JTF 667 joint fire support to provide support to defeat NTMEF in JTFAO,
concurrently denying se of LOC to NT air and sea craft.
(c) Purpose. Defeat of NT forces on PANAY and PALAWAN and set the
conditions for the conduct of COIN operations.
(d) Execution. JTF 667 JFECC will coordinate STA and joint offensive support to
locate and attack HPT and HVT IAW Target List: C2, FIRES, GBAD, aircraft and
communication nodes in PALAWAN and PANAY. J - SEAD will continue to

lanes between NT & BX. IO focuses on convincing NT leadership that further
resistance is futile and to cease combat operations. IO garners and maintains
public support of JTF-OSS while continuing to undermine public support and
legitimacy of the NT. Priority of joint fire support effort is defeat of NTMEF on
PANAY; secondary effort is support to JFEO on PALAWAN.
(e) Assessment. NT ground formations defeated on PALAWAN and PANAY.
Isolate NT forces LOC from NT to prevent extraction. Local populace remains
supportive of JTF 667 OSS and actions while resolve of NT leadership continues
to degrade.

the NTMEF (NT and insurgency). Joint fires concurrently support transition to N
Peacekeeping operations while simultaneously maintaining the capability to
interdict LOC between BX and NT.
(b) Task. CFMCC BPT intercept NT shipping along LOC and provide NGS to
maintain BX territorial integrity. CFACC BPT enforce NFZ over LOC. CFLCC
BPT execute joint fires as necessary throughout the AO to maintain territorial
integrity in support of COIN operations.
(c) Purpose. Establish the military conditions necessary for the transition to N-led
Peacekeeping operations without node external or internal threat.
(d) Execution. JTF 667 JFECC will coordinate operational targeting focusing on non-
lethal / non-kinetic methods while BPT coordinate kinetic/lethal fire support for
COIN operations. IO focuses on stabilising BX and supporting transition to N
Peacekeeping. IO also to convince insurgency that resistance is futile and to cease
combat operations. IO garners and maintains public support of JTF-OSS while

Forces Agreement (SOFA) Australia-Belesia, 11 April 2006

**Introduction**

1. The legal basis for any warlike operation is generally under the auspices of
   the United Nations (and in particular the Security Council) and/or the
   invitation and consent of the Government of the Host State. The nature of the
   operation will generally determine whether an international
   agreement/arrangement is required.
2. Diplomatic clearances will generally suffice for low key activities such as
   port visits, KLE or the attendance of ADF personnel to certain events or
   command post exercises. Whereas more complex or sustained operations are
   likely to be supported by an international agreement/arrangement which
   address the scope and basis for ADF activities and the privileges and
   immunities for participating personnel.
3. In the absence of any invitation or consent by a nation state, GoAS will
   ordinarily require either a UN or regional mandate to conduct relevant
   operations in that state.

**Legal Basis**

4. In the case of Operation Steel Sentinel (OSS) and the presence of Australian
   and other Coalition Forces (CJTF 667) in Belesia, that mandate is prescribed
   under UNSCR 8873 (ref A). Specifically, the Security Counsel has authorised
   the establishment and deployment of a multinational military force in Belesia
   – International Belesian Security Assistance Force (IBSAF). The IBSAF’s
   mandate is end the state-initiated hostile action by North Torbia and other
   belligerents, with the following objectives:

a. The expulsion of North Torbian forces from Belesian territory, the
restoration and maintenance of Belesian sovereignty and the deterrence of any
further external aggression against Belesian sovereign territory.

b. The preservation of human life and the alleviation of suffering for affected
populations within Belesia, including the facilitation of humanitarian aid
programs.

c. The re-establishment of a safe and secure environment in Belesia within which
the national government can pursue its own programs for national development,
peace and prosperity.

5. IBSAF is to work within the following parameters:

a. Overall command and control to be exercised by Australia with initial troop
contributing nations of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Indonesia, and
augmented by resources (all types) of other member states.

```
K-2/4
```

b. The primary focus of operations to be within the territorial boundaries of
Belesia. Operations elsewhere may be conducted if required to support or achieve
the objectives set out in paragraph 4 above. All operations within Belesia to be
undertaken in full coordination and cooperation with Belesian authorities and
forces, cognisant of the sovereign authority of the Government of Belesia, its
Departments, Agencies and officials.

c. Be established, deployed and conduct operations in Belesia for an initial
period of twelve (12) months post arrival in theatre with extensions and/or
termination of activities to be determined by the Security Council.

d. Coalition military operations are to minimise any adverse environmental and
economic impacts in Belesia and in the Pacific more broadly to facilitate a
rapid return to peacetime conditions and the commencement of follow-on
development activities after the cessation of hostilities.

6. IBSAF is also required to protect civilians and civilian populated areas
   under threat of attack in Belesia. IBSAF members must also immediately inform
   their chain of command of any measures taken to protect civilians and
   civilian populated areas so that reporting obligations to the Security
   Council can be complied with.

**International Agreement/Arrangements**

7. HQJOC Legal will be consulted during the early planning/scoping of any
   operation in the Asia-Pacific region to ascertain whether existing
   international agreements or arrangements can support the proposed operation
   or whether instruments/agreements will need to be drafted. All international
   agreements and arrangements must be cleared by the Directorate of
   International Government Agreements and Arrangements (DIGAA) and may require
   broader consultation beyond HQJOC to inform their content.
8. As a general guide, international agreements/arrangements can include clauses
   that work to manage risk in the areas of:

a. use of deadly force

b. enforcement of Total Exclusion Zones

c. rules of engagement

d. use of force to maintain peace and stability over a civilian populace

e. handling of PW/CPERS

f. handling of IDP

g. carrying out of infrastructure works

h. rendering of medical/pharmaceutical assistance

i. deployment of personnel for the purposes of engaging in force protection

j. deployment of personnel for the rendering of logistical support.

```
K-3/4
```

9. In short, an international agreement or arrangement will be required for any
   significant event or situation that normally requires special permissions,
   licences or authorisation by the Requesting State or relevant nation
   requiring support/assistance.

**General Provisions in SOFA**

10. The standard provisions in a SOFA or international agreement/arrangement
    _generally_ cover the following but are determined on a case by case basis:

a. criminal jurisdiction

b. civil claims

c. investigations

d. entry/departure requirements

e. freedom of movement

f. use of services and facilities

g. communications

h. security measures

i. uniform and carriage of arms

j. use of services and facilities

k. recognition of licences/qualifications.

11. The AS/BX SOFA of 2006 (Ref B) provides the basis of relationships between
    the forces of CJTF 667 and Belesia. Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) to CJTF
    667 may fall under the general provisions under Ref B, but may enact their
    own SOFA with Belesia.

**General Considerations Rule of Engagement**

12. The mission specific ROE are detailed in Annex L to this OPORD.
13. **Use of force in self defence.** Use of force in self-defence must be
    reasonable in light of the danger posed, the level of the force must be
    necessary to avert the threat and the use of force must be limited in its
    intensity and duration to that which is reasonably necessary in the
    circumstances. Where circumstances permit the use of force is to be
    graduated.
14. **Interaction with the local population.** Where the ADF tasking is likely
    to involve interaction with the local population, including in support of
    local law enforcement, it may require ADF personnel to restrict the movement
    of civilians. In these circumstances careful consideration of appropriate
    mission specific ROE will likely be required.
15. **Targeting.** Annex I to this OPORD provides details on constraints or
    procedures for the conduct of targeting activities and generation of
    effects.

```
K-4/4
```

**Interoperability arrangements between ADF and coalition partners**

16. AS and other coalition forces generally operate under national lines, i.e.
    their own national ROE. Interoperability between ADF and coalition forces
    will generally be enhanced with a combined Authorities Matrix and Decision
    Support Matrix which reflects any differences across the force. TCN will
    comply with the CJTF 667 ROE or National Command Authority ROE whichever is
    the stricter.
17. It is anticipated that ADF and coalition forces will cooperate with each
    other in relation to an investigations of any accident or incident and that
    investigations or subsequent inquiries may be conducted jointly or in
    parallel along national lines. In circumstances where an investigation is to
    be conducted by a coalition partner, HQJOC Legal should be engaged.

**Legal Support**

18. **Legal Assistance to ADF personnel.** Legal assistance can be sought
    through either: the legal officer (if any) force assigned to the specific
    operation/activity; or otherwise, through HQJOC SO2 Legal.
19. **Legal Support to Commander.** Legal support to command can be sought
    through either: the legal officer (if any) force assigned to the HQ CJTF; or
    otherwise, through HQJOC SO2 Legal Domestic Operations.

**RULES OF ENGAGEMENT – OPERATION STEEL SENTINEL**

**References:** A. MC 362/1 NATO Rules of Engagement (ROE), dated 27 JUN 03 B.
San Remo Handbook on Rules of Engagement, dated 09 NOV 09 C. UN Security Council
Resolution 8869 dated XXXXXXX D. UN Security Council Resolution 8873 dated
XXXXXXX

1. **General Principles**

a. Introduction. The United Nations, has issued policy and military guidance on
the strategic objectives for operations in Belesia. For the International
Belesian Security Assistance Force (IBSAF), it has been decided to adopt NATO
principles and procedures, with the San Remo Manual for Rules of Engagement for
the promulgation and amendment of ROE. General guidance in relation to NATO ROE,
is set out in Ref A, with further clarification of San Remo ROE at Ref B. When
referring to IBSAF, this reference shall encompass Combined Joint Task
Force-Operation 667 (CJTF 667) and all attached force elements. COMD CJTF 667 is
referred to as COMD IBSAF in this document.

b. Authority. The authority providing the legal framework for the operation is
set out in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and the United Nations
Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) in accordance with Refs B and D. Any
changes to this ROE shall be authorised by CJOPS with Coalition partner input.
The current authority provides for IBSAF to take all necessary measures to carry
out the tasks listed in UNSCRs 8869 and 8873, including the use of deadly force
in order to fulfil its mission.

c. ROE Definition. ROE are directives that define the circumstances, conditions,
degree and manner, in which force or actions, which might be construed as
provocative, may or may not be applied or taken. The ROE implemented for this
operation provide the sole authority for IBSAF to use force. Although the ROE do
not limit the inherent right of self-defence, different national approaches to
the definition of self-defence may result in inconsistency between multinational
forces as to where the right to use force in self-defence ends and the use of
force authorised by the mission ROE begins.

d. Geographical Application of the ROE. These ROE apply within the geographical
boundaries of the JFAO as defined in the CJTF 667 OPORD at paragraphs 1.h.(1)
and (2).

e. Self-Defence. Nothing in these ROE shall negate a commander’s right to take
all necessary action for unit and individual self-defence.

```
(1) Individuals and units have a right to defend themselves against attack or an imminent
attack.
(a) In exercising this right, individuals and units will act in accordance with national
law. Therefore more detailed and specific guidance from Troop Contributing
Nations (TCN) applicable for their respective forces will be required.
```

```
L-2/4
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(b) Self-defence is the use of such necessary and proportional force, including deadly
force, to defend against an attack or an imminent attack.
(c) The principles of necessity and proportionality, together with terms “imminent”
and “attack” defined in Ref. A para 7 will apply for all IBSAF.
(2) Within the general concept of self-defence, IBSAF have the right to use force that is
necessary and proportional to defend civilians accompanying IBSAF, including UN
personnel, and civilians who have been taken hostage.
```

f. Extended Self-defence. Ref A stipulates, “In keeping with the principles of
the Alliance, within the general concept of self-defence,
Coalition/Coalition-led forces and personnel also have the right to take
appropriate measures, including the use of necessary and proportional force to
defend other Coalition/Coalition-led forces and personnel from attack or from
imminent attack”. “Coalition led forces” include any IBSAF forces OPCON, TACOMD
or TACON (for the time being) to CJTF 667.

g. Application of ROE and the Use of Force. Within this coalition for Operation
STEEL SENTINEL, ROE are authorised by IBSAF. The chain of command is therefore
responsible to disseminate the ROE, ensure understanding, request clarifications
and, seek amendments as required. The chain of command also assumes the
responsibility to ensure compliance and determine incompatibilities. During the
conduct of the operation the use of force principles described in Ref A para
10-12 apply.

h. Applicable Law. The ROE applies principles of international law. The IBSAF
mission must be communicated and correctly perceived as being lawfully
requested/mandated by the UN. COMD IBSAF will engage with non-military entities
mitigating any incorrect perception of the Coalition presence in the Joint Force
Area of Operations (JFAO) (once authority to coordinate is delegated).
Simultaneously, coordinating efforts will be conducted at the strategic level,
communicating the legitimacy of this UN-sanctioned operation.

```
(1) International Law. The conduct of IBSAF is circumscribed by international law,
including the applicable principles derived from the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).
When applicable, IBSAF also have a responsibility to obey other International treaties
that affect military operations. In particular, IBSAF must comply with the LOAC
principles: distinction, military necessity, proportionality, and humanity.
(2) National Laws. TCNs shall adhere to their national laws. They are not obliged to
execute tasks or operations that would constitute a breach of their national laws.
Therefore, nations should issue national restrictions, caveats and/or clarifying
instructions to their members, COMD IBSAF and coalition partners in order to ensure
compliance with national law. Any such national clarifying instructions must not be
more permissive than the ROE. The normal mechanisms for notification of such
national restrictions and/or clarifying instructions are FORCEPREP/Order of Battle
Transfer of Authority (ORBATTOA) messages.
(a) In the case of sending enabling forces to the JFAO, TCN should communicate
their caveats prior to deployment, facilitating an initial package of ROE being
implemented for theater enablers.
```

```
L-3/4
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(b) Where nations have expressed caveats on involvement or the use of force, such
caveats will be summarized and the resultant impact on the mission identified.
The full range of national caveats held by IBSAF should be communicated to the
operational level, analyzed and applied as soon as possible. IBSAF Point of
Contact (POC) for this activity is the CJ35.
```

2. **IBSAF Authorised ROE**

a. General Outline and Application. IBSAF authorised ROE enable the successful
execution of the mission, while safeguarding all forces. They apply to all IBSAF
elements, and can only be deviated from on the basis of national caveats or
restrictions.

b. ROE Request /Authorisation and Implementation Procedure. The procedures to
request, authorise, and implement ROE are set out in Ref A.

c. ROE Changes and Supplemental ROE. The ROE authorised by the IBSAF are found
in ROE Authorization Messages (ROEAUTHs) and implemented by COMD IBSAF in ROE
Implementation Messages (ROEIMPLs) may only be changed with the approval of
CJOPS. Any limitation or restriction in its application of LOAC that is viewed
as a potential threat to the safety of the force and/or the successful conduct
of the mission should be addressed upon discovery and reported up the chain of
command. Supplemental ROE measures that may be required due to changes in the
operational situation or otherwise may be submitted in a ROE Request Message
(ROEREQ). This includes requests for ROE previously requested but denied, new or
additional ROE.

d. Dissemination. The ROE for IBSAF will be appropriately classified to allow
dissemination to all TCN. The full ROE and use of force guidance might contain
sensitive material, publication of which could harm operations. IBSAF ROE
authorisation should be accompanied by guidance in the form of a Political
Policy Statement (PPS).The PPS should be complemented by Political Policy
Indicators (PPIs).

e. Protection of Persons and Property with Designated Special Status. Persons
with Designated Special Status (PDSS) and Property with Designated Special
Status (PRDSS) may be protected against hostile intent or hostile acts only
pursuant to ROE. The authority to designate PDSS or PRDSS is restricted to COMD
IBSAF.

3. Other Considerations. The instructions outlined below are amplifying
   mission-specific guidance based on international law, but should only be
   undertaken pursuant to IBSAF authorised ROE:

a. Detention. Persons may be detained as a force protection measure to prevent
them from conducting acts against Coalition forces, Host Nation Security Forces
(HNSF) or the HN civilian population. COMD IBSAF guidance on actions to be taken
when detaining persons can be found in Annex AD and must be adhered to by all
IBSAF elements involved in detention.

b. Riot Control Means. Riot control means (RCM) must not be used as a means of
warfare. RCM may only be used at the discretion of the Appropriate Commander in
the following circumstances:

```
(1) To protect the safety of IBSAF personnel, HN, IO, governmental organisations and / or
NGO or PDSS; or
```

```
L-4/4
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(2) To protect the property of IBSAF, HA, IO, governmental organisations, NGO or PDSS;
or
```

c. Prevention of Serious Crimes. The use of minimum force, up to and including
the use of deadly force, may be used to prevent serious crimes (which includes
trafficking in Human Beings) against a person, including civilian, who
unlawfully commits, or is about to commit, an act which endangers life of PDSS
or coalition forces, or is likely to cause serious bodily harm, in circumstances
where there is no other way to prevent the act. The use of minimum force
includes the authority to detain the person. All use of force in the prevention
of serious crimes must be reported through the chain of command at the earliest
opportunity.

d. Soldiers’ Cards. All IBSAF members must carry a Soldiers’ Card issued by the
relative Component Command or national authorities adhering to this ROE. TCN may
issue translations of the Soldiers’ Card issued by the Component Commands. The
TCN Soldiers’ Card may include national clarifying instructions in accordance
with the main body of this Annex. The nationally authorised Soldiers’ Card,
translations of Soldiers’ Card or any clarifying instructions must be developed
in consultation with or disclosed to COMD IBSAF. No nationally authorised
Soldiers’ Card will permit a wider use of force than authorised by this ROE.

e. Avoidance of Collateral Damage. In all cases, every effort should be made to
minimize, to the maximum extent possible, any loss of life or injury to
civilians or damage to civilian objects resulting from the use of force.
Collateral damage is incidental to military action and must not be excessive or
disproportionate to the military advantage to be gained from the specific
attack.

f. Prohibition against Reprisals. The punitive use of force is prohibited.

g. Duty to Report. Each situation resulting in a detention, or involving the use
of deadly force, or use of riot control means (if authorised), whether it
results in casualties or not, is to be reported through the chain of command as
soon as possible.

h. Right to Position Defence. The use of force is authorised to defend a
position.

i. ROE for Open Sources. Bringing ROE into the open discourse may become
beneficial for many reasons (e.g. STRATCOM). Because ROE contain sensitive
information, the release of which could be harmful to the mission, IBSAF may
indicate what information is releasable to the public, parallel to ROEAUTH
message, by giving guidance on Public Information (PI) policy concerning release
of ROE.

CJTF 667 OPORD
DATED XXXXXX
```

**MILITARY PUBLIC AFFAIRS**

**Reference:** ADFP 3.13.2 Military Public Affairs 14 Feb 2020

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: Zulu.**

1. **Situation**

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of CJTF 667 OPORD 01, Annex B
(Intelligence), Annex J (Information Operations) and Annex Q (Civil-Military
Operations).

b. General. The Military Public Affairs (MPA) office is assigned as a Command
Advisory Group section (J09) to CJTF 667. MPA provides timely and accurate
information in support of the Commander’s objectives for strategic
communication. MPA informs, educates and counters misinformation with respect to
key audiences (both civilian and military) regarding CJTF 667 objectives,
accomplishments and challenges. By engaging local and international media, as
well as through social media, MPA is able to disseminate key themes and messages
to a wide audience in order to engender and maintain support for CJTF 667 and to
correct misinformation in the public domain. Via spoken and written word and
through still and video images, MPA represents a trusted and powerful tool to
reach diverse audiences. Robust and effective MPA activities are fundamental to
CJTF 667’s ability to proactively communicate to audiences in a truthful and
timely manner. MPA aims to be ‘first with the truth,’ providing the facts
regarding ongoing events and military and humanitarian activities, and by
assisting the media in reporting accurately by providing context. It also
informs public perception and opinion by providing reliable, timely and accurate
information to local and international media, while monitoring media outlets to
ensure that information is disseminated. Media monitoring collects reports from
all open sources in order to disseminate a complete picture of media coverage to
assist Key Leader Engagement in decision-making and ensure consistency with
other MPA organisations throughout the Joint Force Area of Operations (J FAO).
All components of CJTF 667 as well as Host Nations’ armed forces and IO and NGOs
are primary sources regarding security-related and humanitarian issues. This
annex provides policy guidance and tasking concerning the public affairs
coverage of CJTF 667 operations. It includes coordinating instructions for
releasing information and visual products, news coverage, media support and,
support of the internal information and outreach engagement programs.

c. Communication in the Information Environment.

```
(1) Host Nation. Belesia’s state-run and public media compete with private and opposition
publications and broadcasters. Internet, television and mobile phone networks are more
accessible to much of the population in the JFAO, notably in urban areas. TV is the
most-popular medium. In more isolated rural areas and islands, traditional
communication print and media remain the most influential communication tools.
Belesian government bodies are in the lead for shaping and influencing their publics’
opinions regarding progress made in re-establishing regional development and security.
CJTF 667 will deliver support and assistance in this area to local authorities. CJTF 667
```

```
M-2/8
MPA effort is aimed at attaining and maintaining popular support for the mission at the
higher level by explaining the goals and legitimacy of the UN-sanctioned IBSAF
mission and of CJTF 667’s intentions, actions and achievements as well as by
developing a media campaign based on success stories that appeal to the public.
(2) International Media. All personnel must understand the power of the international media
and the importance they play in maintaining support for ongoing operations. The
international media, to include traditional journalists, documentarians and reputable
bloggers, will significantly influence western public and political opinion. The
international media is strongly augmented by local stringers, who will accompany the
other local media representatives at media functions. These stringers will feed the
international media from Coalition events as well as from adversary spokespersons.
(3) North Torbia. Transparency in political and social debate is subject to extremely tight
governmental control in Nth Torbia, resulting in the populace being extremely hard to
influence from external government and organisation. The Nth Torbian government
continues to use a wide range of media as an integral part of its activities to influence
the populace and international actors. Nth Torbia and its affiliated partners and proxies
will attempt to shape the information environment based on their interests.
```

d. Core Audiences.

```
(1) Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) members, countries and regional policymakers,
opinion leaders, publics, service members, and families.
(2) Regional, national, and international News Media Representatives (NMRs).
(3) Belesian and Nth Torbian publics.
(4) CJTF 667 TCN service members and civilian staff.
(5) Host Nations Defence Forces.
(6) International Organisations (IO) and NGOs.
```

e. Assumptions.

```
(1) The Nth Torbian government and the Nth Torbian Armed Forces can be expected to
mount a massive, carefully constructed, well-orchestrated, worldwide propaganda
campaign as part of its military campaign.
(2) Nth Torbia will use political, economic, cultural, and military issues and events as
opportunities to discredit Coalition resolve, military capability and intentions in the free
press. Nth Torbia will use the media to further its propaganda goal to weaken public
support and confidence in Coalition military resolve and/or intentions.
(3) Non-state organisations and proxies associated with Nth Torbia can be expected to use
the media to further their goals.
```

2. **Mission**. CJTF 667 plans and executes active communications and military
   public affairs activities in support of Operation STEEL SENTINEL in order to
   provide responsive, timely, and accurate information about CJTF 667
   activities to both domestic and foreign audiences and to counter enemy
   misinformation in order to support the goals and objectives of the Commander.

```
M-3/8
```

3. **Execution.**

a. Concept of Operations. MPA policy is maximum disclosure with minimum delay,
but consistent with operational security and Privacy Act provisions. MPA will a
ssist in the creation of conditions that maintain Coalition integrity and the
confidence of TCNs as well as the International Community in CJTF 667 operations
by:

```
(1) Providing timely information and news products that demonstrate the core messages;
(2) Providing timely information about CJTF 667 operations to public and news media
representatives and facilitate news media operations;
(3) Providing internal command information programs and products to keep units and
family members informed;
(4) Countering effects of Nth Torbian propaganda attempts through an active MPA posture
by informing and educating external and internal publics of the actual situation and
facts;
(5) Conducting media embed program consistent with AS and/or TCN media embed
directives;
(6) Facilitating outreach engagement initiatives to inform and educate local, national and
international opinion leaders, academics, and defence-issues analysts; and
(7) Maintaining and managing CJTF 667 social media.
```

b. MPA Effects.

```
(1) CJTF 667 is recognised as a regional stabilising force by national and international
audiences.
(2) TCNs and public audiences receive timely updates of CJTF 667 mission progress and
significant events to include enemy and friendly casualty status without compromising
operational security.
(3) International recognition and support for the IBSAF Coalition is strong and unwavering.
(4) Nth Torbian propaganda is effectively countered by increased accurate and independent
reporting from international, national, and local news agencies.
(5) International public understands that Nth Torbian people are not the targets of CJTF 667
military efforts.
(6) CJTF 667 forces and TCNs are informed of mission progress and critical issues of force
protection and safety and efforts to sustain health, welfare, and morale.
(7) Increased reporting of defeats suffered by Nth Torbian military forces by international,
national, and local media.
(8) Key audiences recognise CJTF 667 will transition authority to follow-on forces or Host
Nations for stability or peace support operations once security conditions permit.

```

```
M-5/8
```

(6) Key Leader Engagements (KLE) are critical to the success of all MPA
operations. They should be used as frequently and in as many situations and
mediums as possible.

(7) Provide military public affairs support to the CJTF 667 command to highlight
the successes of the operation to Target Audiences through internal and external
media coverage, KLE, and visual imagery.

(11) Designate Unit Public Affairs Representatives (UPAR) for each Bn sized
element. UPARs are responsible for briefing commanders on current Public Affairs
Guidance (PAG) and ensuring PAG is disseminated and units are prepared to
facilitate media engagements. All appropriate military personnel should be
provided with Talking Points prior to media engagements to help facilitate
communication synchronization and ensure they understand the overarching intent
on the mission.

(12) Ensure that subordinate commanders and MPA personnel are familiar with
communications, transportation and other media support requirements; approved
PAG and ground rules concerning this operation.

(13) Do not interfere with News Media Representatives (NMR) as long as they do
not interfere with the execution of the mission or threaten to violate OPSEC.

(14) Advise CJTF 667 PAO immediately of news media exposure to classified
information or any possible media ground rules violations.

(15) CJTF 667 personnel are not authorised to confiscate media cameras, film,
audio/videotape, or reporter’s notebooks. Any questions regarding the specific

Appendix 1).

(19) Following official announcement of deployment, units may acknowledge they
have been notified for a deployment; however, they may not release specific
details that may violate OPSEC. Commanders are encouraged to release information
if appropriate and PAOs should be prepared to address media requests in support
of family readiness efforts.

```
M-6/8
```

(20) In the event of a large scale incident, critical information leak,
capture/kill of a key leader, or mass casualty situation which may require
communications consequence management, all key information (5W’s) must be
forwarded immediately to CJTF 667 PAO.

(21) In the event of a crisis, the CJTF 667 PAO will coordinate with higher
headquarters to determine release authority and appropriate public statements to
make.

(22) Requests for public affairs information (RFIs). Submit all RFIs to
CJTF 667.

(23) Support for News Media Representatives.

```
(a) Media Escort.
```

1. Accreditation. Requirements for accreditation will be established by the
   Coalition/national-level defence agencies and supported by CJTF 667 PAO. As a
   minimum, the CJTF 667 J09 will institute procedures to determine the
   legitimacy of individuals as _bona fide_ media representatives entitled to
   receive support afforded by TCN and CJTF 667 forces. News media
   representatives must have passports and working visas identifying them as
   journalists to fulfill CJTF 667 accreditation requirements.
2. Assignment. CJTF 667 J09, in consultation with subordinate unit PAOs, will
   determine the assignment of NMR to specific subordinate units within the JFAO
   to preclude overloading any single unit. Where possible, media
   representatives will be assigned to their preferred location.
3. Facilities. CJTF 667 units will provide media embeds with adequate
   accommodation, meals, and transportation.
4. Inoculations. NMR accompanying CJTF 667 in the field will be required to have
   the same inoculations, at their own expense, administered to military
   personnel participating in the operations.
5. Communications. CJTF 667 and major subordinate commands will provide
   communications services free of charge to civilian media representatives when
   commercial facilities are not available. Transmission by military
   communication facilities will be on a non-interference basis. News media will
   be advised of the status of their traffic.
6. Courier Flights. Courier flights may carry news material to appropriate
   processing or distribution points on a non-interference basis without charge.
   News media will be informed of the status of their material.
7. Transportation. CJTF 667 will provide accredited media representatives with
   military transportation into and within the JFAO when such travel is in
   connection with assignments to cover the operation and when commercial
   transportation is restricted into the area or unavailable.

```
M-7/8
(b) Security. The presence of news media representatives in operational areas will
require the following considerations concerning security:
```

1. Procedures will be implemented to preclude the unauthorised release of
   classified or sensitive information. NMRs violating embargo agreements will
   be immediately dis-embedded.
2. Media representatives can access operations, intelligence, and other
   classified areas only in case of strong need and under strict escort and
   control.
3. Individuals are not authorised to release information to media nor are they
   permitted to agree to a personal interview without prior coordination with
   the PAO supporting that unit or command. When the PAO has coordinated the
   media visit, personnel may grant media requests for interviews and provide
   only unclassified information in interviews, briefings, and written
   materials. Do not make “off the record” statements to media representatives.
   (c) Audio-Visual. CJTF 667 will assist the media as necessary in obtaining
   audio- visual coverage. (d) Embedded media will abide by established ground
   rules on releasable and non- releasable information.
4. **Sustainment.**

```
a. Administration. Media are required to carry their own equipment.
b. Logistics.
(1) Non-embedded media (Unilateral) covering our operations should be “self-
sustaining”. CJTF 667 PAO will coordinate additional logistical support to media
as required. Intent is to maximize use of Host Nation Support (HNS). Host Nation
Contract Support is used if support/service is not available through military logistic
means or through HNS.
(2) Media embeds will have their own protective equipment. Military embeds will be
provided with military transportation (ground or air) into and within the JFAO
while covering the operation.
(3) Embedded NMRs will be entitled to medical care provided to CJTF 667 personnel
in the event of life threatening injuries.
```

5. **Command and Signal.**

a. Media will use commercial means of communications if available. If commercial
lines are not available, official military means will be authorised. Military
satellite transmission facilities can be provided when operationally feasible.

b. Media may use independent satellite uplinks for transmission of products from
field locations when the on- scene commander determines transmission will not
violate OPSEC or compromise an ongoing operation.

c. CJTF 667 PAO co-locates with CJTF 667 HQ.

   operations, duties, and responsibilities and should not discuss specific
   aspects of the units, including number of personnel, shortages, and/or
   equipment.
3. Military members should **not** discuss or speculate on how the unit might be
   employed.
4. **No** discussion of operational details, plans, or possible future
   operations.
5. **No** discussion of exact unit deployment destination to include
   arrival/departure locations.
6. Do talk about the training we do.
7. Do **not** discuss specifics of Rules of Engagement.
8. Do talk about your job and what you do.
9. Leaders - Do talk about your members and unit/formation.
10. Everything is on the record.
11. Deal in the facts – do **not** speculate or address hypothetical questions.
12. **Avoid** speculating or commenting on things “outside your lane”, such as
    other governments or government officials.
13. Do **not** discuss classified information. The media is not the enemy, but
    remember OPSEC. If not sure, say “Due to Operational Security, I cannot
    discuss that subject.”

FORCE PROTECTION
```

**Reference** : ADDP 3.22 Force Protection 2015

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order** : Zulu

**1. Situation**.

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of CJTF 667 OPORD 01 and Annex B
(Intelligence).

```
(1) General. Commanders and staffs synchronise, integrate, and organize capabilities and
resources throughout the operations process to preserve combat power and the freedom
of action and to mitigate the effects of threats and hazards. Protection safeguards the
force, personnel (combatants and non-combatants), systems, and physical assets of
coalition partners. Survivability refers to the capacity, fitness, or tendency to remain
alive or in existence. For the military, survivability is about much more than mere
survival - it is also about remaining effective. Military forces are composed of personnel
and physical assets, each having their own inherent survivability qualities or capabilities
that permit them to avoid or withstand hostile actions or environmental conditions while
retaining the ability to fulfill their primary mission. Force Protection is one of the six
warfighting functions which include Command, Situational Understanding, Force
Generation and Sustainment, Force Projection and Force Application.
(2) Force Protection (FP). Force protection is defined as preventive measures taken to
mitigate hostile actions against ADF personnel, resources, facilities, and critical
information (see Ref A). FP measures may be defensive (active and passive), offensive
and recuperative measures.
```

b. Protection within the Operations Process. The synchronisation, integration,
and organization of capabilities and resources to preserve combat power from the
effects of threats and hazards are essential. The ability to protect and
preserve the force and secure the area of operations is vital in seizing,
retaining, and exploiting the initiative. Protection emphasises the importance
of planning and expanding our protection priorities, to include protecting
coalition partners, civilian populations, equipment, resources, infrastructure,
and cultural landmarks across the range of military operations. It focuses on
adapting our force to better leverage, integrate, and synchronise capabilities
and better understand operational environments. It emphasises the need for all
ADF members to identify, prevent, or mitigate threats and hazards. Mutually
supporting and overlapping protection capabilities through operational and
tactical level actions better respond, and recover from threat and hazard
effects and to deter, counterattack, neutralize, and defeat the threats.

```
O-2/6
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

c. Protection Principles. The following principles of protection provide
military professionals with a context for implementing protection efforts,
developing schemes of protection, and allocating resources:

```
(1) Command Responsibility. FP is a function of command. Commanders at all levels are
responsible and accountable for the protection of their assets. Subordinate commanders
may use their discretion in imposing additional FP measures, but may not reduce the
measures imposed by this HQ without prior approval.
(2) Risk Management. Risk Management is the coordinated activities to direct and control
the Joint Force with regards to risk. Risk management ensures that risk is managed
effectively, efficiently and coherently across the Joint Force.
(3) Coordination. FP must be fully coordinated across all components, multi-agency and
multinational elements. It is essential to coordinate FP planning at the strategic,
operational and tactical levels in order to ensure a unified approach and mitigate
vulnerabilities that might otherwise be exploited by a threat.
(4) Integrated. FP is integrated with other activities, systems, efforts, and capabilities
associated with unified joint operations to provide strength and structure to the overall
effort. Integration must occur vertically and horizontally with coalition partners
throughout the operations process.
(5) Economy. Excessive allocation of resources for FP may remove capabilities needed to
accomplish the mission. Economical use of FP capabilities allows the commander to
focus resources on the protection of those assets that are deemed critical to operational
effectiveness and mission success.
(6) Prioritisation. There will always be insufficient resources to protect every asset against
every threat all of the time. Priority should be given to centres of gravity, both tangible
and intangible.
(7) Flexibility. FP policies and measures must have the flexibility and agility to respond to
rapidly changing threats, within resource limitations.
(8) Layered. FP capabilities are arranged using a layered approach to provide strength and
depth. Layering reduces the destructive effect of a threat or hazard through the
dispersion of energy or the culmination of the force.
(9) Redundant. Protection efforts are often redundant anywhere that a vulnerability or a
critical point of failure is identified. Redundancy ensures that specific activities,
systems, efforts, and capabilities that are critical for the success of the overall protection
effort have a secondary or auxiliary effort of equal or greater capability.
(10) Enduring. Protection capabilities are ongoing activities for maintaining the objectives of
preserving combat power, populations, partners, essential equipment, resources, and
critical infrastructure in every phase of an operation.

d. Threat and Risk Assessment.

```
(1) Conventional threats. See Annex B. The North Torbian Marine Expeditionary Forces
(NTMEF) essentially represent a “near peer” threat with a wide range of capabilities. As
they have demonstrated, they have sufficient forces capabilities to seize and control key
infrastructure and large areas of terrain in a littoral environment. They also possess the
necessary capabilities to project and sustain power beyond their national boundaries.
Whilst the Torbian People’s Army (TPA) is known to hold quantities of CBRN
capabilities, it is highly unlikely they will utilise these weapons during this conflict.
(2) Unconventional Threats.
(a) Visayan Peoples Front (VPF) Insurgents. The VPF is an armed insurgent group
committed to establishing an independent entity composed of the islands of
Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol. Over time, the group, which originally sought
the creation of a separate secular state, demanded the exclusion of Muslims and
creation of a Christian nation. The VPF has aided the NTMEF in securing key
infrastructure and installations during the early stages of NT occupation of Panay.
Levels of cooperation between the NTMEF and the VPF at this time is unknown.
(b) Free Sulu Movement (FSM) Separatists. The FSM is a conglomeration of anti-
federation factions of the Belesian archipelago. The group seeks to break free of
the alleged overreach of the Belesian central government and abuses of the
Belesian Federation National Guard. The FSM is not known to be actively
supporting the NTMEF in Panay or Palawan.
(c) Satu Pulau Satu Negara (SPSN) Insurgents. SPSN (roughly translated to One
Island, One Nation) believes that all of Luzon should be united under a single
national flag. They mainly restrict their actions on Luzon and are not expected to
be a significant threat in the CJTF 667 JFAO.
(d) Black Societies Criminal Network. The Black Societies Criminal Network is
based mainly in Olvana with networks and interests in Belesia and surrounding
nations. This criminal network is involved in armed robbery, racketeering,
smuggling, narcotics trafficking, prostitution, gambling, and contract killings. The
Black Societies will not involve themselves directly in the current conflict but
may capitalise on demand through black market operations.
(e) Tantoco Cartel Criminal Organisation. Originating in South Torbia (RT), the
Tantoco Cartel operates across the region with networks and interests in Olvana
and Belesia. Like the Black Society, the Tantoco Cartel is involved in all forms of
illegal activities. Recent expansion into Belesia and Olvana has resulted in turf
disputes with the Black Society.
(3) Non-Military Threats. See also CJTF 667 OPORD 01 Annex AA (Health Support).
(a) Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) / Contaminated Grounds. BX holds large
amounts of toxic industrial chemicals for multiple purposes, including mining,
production of electronic goods, water purification, wastewater management,
pesticides and fertiliser to increase agricultural output. A mine collapse in Panay a
```

```
few years ago resulted in a release of 20.6 million tons of waste water into a
nearby river.
(b) Pollution. BX faces significant pollution problems stemming from poor industrial
practices. High levels of air pollution require mitigating measures to ensure CJTF
667 members health and safety.
(c) Potable Water. The majority of the BX archipelago’s urban population has access
to potable water. In rural areas people must rely on local sources such as rivers,
streams and wells to obtain water for cooking, drinking and washing. Currently,
about 90% of all Belesians can access potable water. All water sources are
considered potentially contaminated and not potable until tested.
(d) Sewage. Seventy-five percent of the population has access to improved sanitation,
predominantly in the developed urban areas. Even in the cities, this does not
always equate to fixing plumbing in residences, but also includes improved
latrines. The lack of universal or adequate sanitation contributes to the high rate of
infectious disease spread, especially in the dense urban environments.
(e) Disease. The following diseases are known to be present in BX:
```

1. Diarrheal diseases;
2. Hepatitis A;
3. Malaria;
4. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;
5. Leptospirosis;
6. Schistosomiasis;
7. Hepatitis;
8. Tuberculosis; and
9. Q Fever. **2. Mission**. CJTF 667 will protect the force and conserves combat
   power against threats and risks associated with the conduct of operations
   throughout Operation STEEL SENTINEL. **3. Execution**.

a. General. Commanders must deliberately plan and integrate the application of
military force against an adversary while protecting the force and preserving
combat power. Commanders develop protection systems for each phase of an
operation or major activity. They integrate and synchronise FP tasks to reduce
risk, mitigate identified vulnerabilities, and act on opportunity. When properly
integrated and synchronised, the tasks and systems that comprise the FP
warfighting function effectively protect the force, enhance the preservation of
combat power, and increase the probability of mission success.

```
O-5/6
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

b. Risk. The FP posture should be based on risk management, not risk
elimination. Deliberate or accidental casualties are a reality of military
operations, as are material and equipment losses and an overemphasis in avoiding
them may impact adversely on the achievement of the mission. The component
commanders therefore must balance risk within the context of mission
accomplishment. Component commanders should establish FP awareness within their
staffs and provide suitable advice and direction to subordinate units. FP
functions should be fully integrated and coordinated in the operational planning
process from the outset.

c. Tasks Throughout. Component Commands conduct FP operations to protect the
force and conserve combat power in the JFAO. Large troop concentrations and
sustainment facilities shall be protected from NT missile/CBRN attacks by
establishing an integrated Air Missile Defense system with the BX Defense Force.
Vulnerability assessments are to be conducted for staging areas, C2 nodes, and
MSRs / ASRs concerning threats from CBRN, IEDs, missile attacks and other
indirect fires as well as direct attack throughout this operation. Friendly air
superiority must be achieved as soon as possible. Operational threats from enemy
UAVs/UASs must be determined and mitigated. We must take clear measures and
undertake effective coordination to ensure inter-operability between various
TCNs within CJTF 667 and with BX Defense Forces. The implementation of
successful FP measures will be particularly important for safeguarding the CJTF
667 Center of Gravity (our strike aircraft capability). Supporting tasks of the
FP warfighting function include:

```
(1) Conduct operational area security.
(2) Employ safety techniques (including fratricide avoidance).
(3) Implement OPSEC.
(4) Provide intelligence support to protection.
(5) Implement physical security procedures.
(6) Apply anti-terrorism (AT) measures.
(7) Conduct law and order.
(8) Conduct survivability operations.
(9) Provide force health protection.
(10) Conduct chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) operations.
(11) Provide explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and protection support.
(12) Coordinate air and missile defense.
(13) Conduct personnel recovery.
(14) Conduct internment and resettlement.
```

d. Protection by Phase of OP STEEL SENTINEL.

```
(1) Phase 0 - Shaping. This Phase will see CJTF 667 forces begin to stage into the JFAO.
The main effort during this phase will be the commencement of shaping operations to
isolate the NTMEF politically, economically and socially. FP during this phase will be
to secure air superiority over Mindanao, and in particular the designated APODs and
SPODs. The FP effort will emphasize OPSEC and safety measures, but will also
```

```
O-6/6
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
address local area security and survivability operations of the APODs/SPODs. CJTF
667 forces are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and information warfare as C4I systems are
established throughout the JFAO, requiring an ongoing focus on cyber security.
```

(2) Phase 1- Denial. This phase will see the commencement of offensive kinetic
operations by CJTF 667. The main effort will be to isolate the NTMEF
logistically in Panay and degrade NTMEF capability. This phase will require
securing the critical sea and air lanes within the JFAO. FP will focus on
preserving sea and air power to ensure control of critical sea/air lanes at a
time chosen for the commencement of Phase 2. FP will be aided by a deception
plan to make the NTMEF think that the main effort will concentrate on Palawan
instead of Panay. Protection to be enhanced by OPSEC.

(3) Phase 2 - Lodgement. This phase will see the lodgement of ground forces in
Panay as the main effort. Amphibious landings will be conducted on Panay along
with landings at an established APOD/SPOD. FP will focus on maintaining control
of the sea and air lanes over and around Panay. Protection to be enhanced by
OPSEC, measures to eliminate fratricide during forward passage of lines with BX
forces already on Panay, and deception measures portraying a lodgement on
Palawan as main effort for as long as possible.

(4) Phase 3 - Neutralise. This phase will see decisive land operations take
place on Panay. The aim of this phase is to defeat the NTMEF on Panay. A
secondary lodgement on Palawan will also occur to defeat NTMEF on Palawan.
Protection to be enhanced by control of all sea and air lanes around Panay and
Palawan and consideration for CBRN threats to be factored into daily MOPP
states.

(5) Phase 4 – Transition. This phase will see the transition of authority from
CJTF 667 to either a UN sanctioned Peacekeeping Force or a follow on HN force.
It will be expected that CJTF 667 FE will remain to conduct Stability Operations
until a replacement force can take over. Protection measures will begin to put
greater emphasis on non- conventional threats, law and order, health, crime,
drugs, safety, protection of captured enemy personnel, operational area
security, physical security, antiterrorism and on coordination of FP measures
with Host Nation. The potential for kidnapping or capture of friendly forces
increases significantly in this phase requiring the establishment of a Joint
Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC). Key risks to CJTF 667 forces throughout this
phase include accidents caused by fatigue or failure to adhere to published SOPs
and standards. The BX government assumes responsibility for their own security
and infrastructure maintenance.

```
O-7/6
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

e. Coordinating Instructions.

```
(1) Electronic Counter Measures (ECM). In order to prevent mutual interference between
other ECM equipment and communications systems, coordination between nations and
other agencies is required for Spectrum Management control.
(2) Training. Personnel and units are to receive appropriate FP training, particularly in
Escalation of Force procedures.
(3) Vulnerability Assessments (VA). In order to ensure that FP measures meet required
standards, site assessments must be conducted for any semi-permanent sites (FOBs,
main camps, etc.). The assessments routinely involve sites visits with interviews with
key specialists and inspection of all FP related procedures and infrastructure, ranging
from defensive positions through classified document handling procedures to food
hygiene. The process is intended to be consultative and can be used by site commanders
to reinforce their cases for improvements to their FP posture.
(4) Protection Working Groups. Protection Working Groups have been established at HQ
CJTF 667 and at subordinate Component Commands.
```

**4. Sustainment**. See Annex R to CJTF 667 OPORD 01. **5. Command and Signal**.

a. Command. FP measures issued by COMD CJTF 667 are valid for all Coalition
members and facilities in the JFAO. Nevertheless, following a threat and risk
assessment, Senior National Commanders may increase FP measures within their
national elements.

b. Reporting. Deviations from the prescribed FP measures, changes in threat, and
FP incidents are to be reported via the CJTF 667 reporting chain. CBRN incidents
are to be reported to COMD CJTF 667 via the CJTF 667 CBRN Warning and Reporting
chain.

**SITUATION**

**1. General**. Information Operations (IO) is the integration, synchronisation
and coordination of two or more non-kinetic means through a number of
Information Related Capabilities (IRC) that generate and sustain a targeted
information advantage. An information advantage is a favourable information
situation relative to a group, organisation or adversary. IO includes both
influencing the decision-making of actors while protecting our own information
and decision-making. These include:

a. Shaping and Influencing (S&I) (at the strategic level);

b. Information Operations (IO) (at the operational level); and

c. Inform and Influence Actions (IIA) (at the tactical level).

2. The IRCs are the tools, capabilities or processes, which can have effects of
   a physical, functional, temporal or psychological nature upon target systems
   and/or target audiences (an individual group selected for an effect). The
   IRCs have many extended sub elements to them but all work towards the same
   aim as the main component under the direction of IO. All actions are
   integrated into the overall campaign plan and are applicable from Phase 0 to
   Phase 4 of an operation and must be planned accordingly and not added later.
   Achievement of Australia’s national aims and national strategic objectives,
   as stated in Ref A, within the South Pacific region rests heavily on CJTF 667
   ability to synchronise and integrate the Info Ops BOS activities with CJTF
   667 Manoeuvre BOS and Offensive Support BOS activities. This Info Ops Annex
   provides the non-kinetic guidance for the CJTF 667 OPLAN IAW Ref B. **3.
   Adversary Forces**. For analysis of operational environment, threat, threat
   forces and assessment of likely en ops, see OPORD Annex B, Intelligence. In
   summary, regional actors including North Torbian (NT) are competing for
   resources within the South Pacific region. It is using regional instability
   as justification for military intervention and the annexation of Panay and
   Palawan island provinces from the sovereign state of Belesia. NT government
   (GoNT) and military (Torbian People’s Army

- TPA)) forces are heavily engaged in air, land and sea operations and shaping
  and influencing effects across the northern most island province of Panay, in
  an undermining attempt to separate it from its nation state of Belesia. This
  has necessitated the United

Nations assembly to pronounce a Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 8873, noted
as Ref C, to re-establish the Government of Belesian (GoB) sovereignty in both
islands of Panay and Palawan. However, TPA information operations activities
have been undertaken for some time and have had the desired effect on the
population and will take some determination to change. This is especially true
given TPA IO elements have an additional IRC in their organisation and which has
been actively deployed. That of terrorism. This non-kinetic IRC has the
capability of producing both lethal and non-lethal effects and is very
successful.

**4. Friendly Forces**. For information and organisations of detailed friendly
forces, groupings, tasks and capabilities, see OPORD Annex C, Operations. Those
friendly force IRC planners, staff and elements to be made available to CJTF 667
IO Branch, include but are not limited to, those below noted;

a. Civil Military Operations (CMO) elements and components including the
provisions and coordination of Civil Affairs (CA) staff and teams (coalition
resource) Civil Aid Programs (CAP), Civil Military Actions or Activities (CMA)
and tactical Civil Military Cooperation (CIMIC) teams.

b. Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) elements and components including the
provision of Radio in a Box (RIAB) broadcast staff and eqpt and speaker
announcement / material delivery teams.

c. Electronic Warfare (EW) elements and components including air strike
capabilities (EA-18 Growler sorties) and ground Direction Finding and Radio
Intercept (LEWT) teams.

d. Key Leader Engagement (KLE) cell for the creation of the liaison architecture
and assignment and coordination of Force Elements (FE) for the implementation of
the KLE plan.

e. Media and Public Affairs (MPA) officers, staff and combat camera teams (CCT)
to be coordinated with IO to achieve the COMD’s desired Public Relations (PR)
effect as detailed in the strategic communications directive and the MPA plan.
This includes media liaison and release of approved targeted public information.

f. Computer Network Operations (CNO) staff and teams to advise on strategic
effects and assist with protection measures. Its strike capability is not
advised and will be noted in the strategic S&I Plan.

g. Deception (DECEP) staff and units to create and implement the larger
operational manoeuvre decep plan and the coordination of tactical level
deception activities. This includes but is not limited to cam and concealment,
dummy sites and decoy wpns, false electronic signatures and the staging of false
activities and lures.

h. Operational Security (OPSEC) staff and teams to advise on OPSEC measures to
protect EEFIs and monitor, investigate and report on OPSEC violations for
further actions.

i. Presence, Posture and Profile (PPP) activities will be a matter for all FE
units and members adherence to follow IAW established procedures, orders,
instructions and the PPP plan.

j. Protective Security (PS) staff and Rear Security, Regimental Provost and
Military Police FE to work towards the PS plan.

k. Information Assurance (IA) activities to secure ICT hardware and software,
networks and routers, data servers and information, and systems access
protection measures IAW Information System Security Procedures (ISSP).

l. Offensive Support (OS) elements along with Joint Fires (JF) units and systems
which support the Manoeuvre BOS but with whom can be leveraged non-lethal
effects such as show of force, fire power demonstrations or destruction of
material IAW synchronised effects plan.

m. Evidentiary Imagery (EI) staff and elements capable or capturing before and
after activities imagery, such as bomb damage assessment to counter that which
may be used against FE by adversary.

n. Military to Military (M2M) networking cell for the creation of the
communications and information architecture between deploy allied and host
nation military force units and HQs, and the publishing of this data for the
implementation of the M2M Plan. M2M should not be confused with the Liaison
Officer function as prescribed in the C2 BOS.

o. Special Technical Operations (STO) staff and elements for the creation and
delivery of those special non-kinetic effects, both lethal and nonlethal which
may be tactically or operationally employed IAW the STO Plan.

p. Other related staff and organisations as detailed by the Comd to achieve a
desired effect on a target using the means at their disposal. These include
resources inside and outside of the JFAO.

**MISSION**

5. Information Operations are to be conducted in support of the CJTF 667 mission
   of conducting military operations to expel all TPA forces from Panay and
   Belesian sovereign territory, in order to create conditions for the
   re-establishment of a safe and secure environment in Belesia and the
   surrounding region in accordance with the provisions of the UNSCR 8873.

**EXECUTION**

6. **Commanders Intent.**

a. **Purpose**. The purpose of CJTF IO within Panay is to DEGRADE adversary
information and information systems whilst protecting and enhancing CJTF
information and information systems.

b**. Method**. IO will support the CJTF 667 mission in accordance with the IRC
taskings as noted in Ref D, through performance of the following inform and
influence actions:

```
(1) PROTECT CJTF legitimacy, information and information systems IOT
ENABLE CJTF 667 operations.
```

```
(2) INFORM Panay civil population of TPA subversion/atrocities IOT
UNDERMINE TPA actions and narrative.
```

```
(3) DEGRADE enemy forces and belligerent actors within Panay IOT
ENHANCE GoB and Panay authorities.
```

```
(4) INFLUENCE Panay civil population to reconcile IOT ASSIST GoB to re-
establish law and order.
```

c. **End state.** All foreign actors have been rejected by Panay civpop,
belligerent groups degraded to ineffectiveness, community groups commencing
reconciliation, GoB endorsed and supported as legitimate authority and CJTF
preparing to conduct retrograde actions.

7. **Concept of Operations.**

a. **Joint Essential Effects.** The desired CJTF joint essential effects are as
follows:

```
(1) 1. PROMOTE GoB and CJTF legitimacy. The immediate acquisition of the
dominant narrative within Panay is essential to achieving specified national
strategic aims. IOT facilitate the below listed joint essential effects, CJTF and
GoB legitimacy are a crucial platform that will both prevent further NT
involvement and undermine TPA shaping and influencing actions.
```

```
(2) 2. ISOLATE Panay from foreign influence. IOT allow Panay to return to
normal patterns of life, external destabilising influences that are affecting the
internal security of Panay must be isolated. If belligerent groups within Panay
are unable to communicate and resupply, their influence on the battle space
will be dramatically reduced.
```

```
(3) 3. DEGRADE belligerent actors within Panay. Once belligerent groups are
isolated from supply and support, these groups must be systematically
degraded to reduce their impact on CJTF and GoB operations. This will be
achieved through synchronisation of direct and indirect kinetic and non-
kinetic CJTF actions to dislocate and neutralise belligerent actors in Panay.
```

```
(4) 4. ASSIST GoB to re-establish law and order. The degradation of
belligerent groups alone will not be sufficient to allow transition of Panay to
HN control. The enhancement of local security forces and government
authorities will be essential to the achievement of the CJTF end state.
```

b. **Joint Effects Tasks (JETs).** In line with the joint essential effects
listed above, the approved JETs are as follows:

(1) **1.1 PROMOTE CJTF legitimacy.** Throughout this operation, it is essential
that CJTF legitimacy is maintained both IOT maintain public support in Panay and
AS and to counter pro-NT narratives that seek to undermine CJTF presence.

(2) **1.2 ENHANCE GoB legitimacy.** IOT achieve the end state it is essential
that both the Panay CIVPOP and the international community accept the reinstated
GoB. Therefore, CJTF is to facilitate every opportunity to enhance the GoB’s
reputation to further counter the NT negative narrative.

(3) **1.3 UNDERMINE NT legitimacy.** IOT prevent NT force projection and
escalation, it is essential that the NT narrative is dismantled at every
opportunity using facts and examples of NT and TPA influence within Panay. This
will undermine NT’s political standing in the region and reduce their impact on
shaping regional and global opinion.

(4) **1.4 EXPOSE TPA atrocities and regional shaping actions.** Linkages to
activities within the TPA shaping and influencing activities will further
degrade NT’s political position and enhance the CJTF narrative.

(5). **2.1 DISLOCATE TPA within Panay.** Where possible, CJTF 667 seeks to
physically and functionally dislocate TPA forces through non-kinetic actions and
non-lethal effects IOT activate TPA withdrawal triggers and avoid kinetic
engagement with CJTF elements.

(6) **2.2 ISOLATE TPA from NT support.** The establishment of air and naval
blockades will prevent TPA provision of materiel and logistic support from/to NT
which can be exploited to create command dilemmas for senior TPA leadership and
to influence subsequent TPA actions.

(7) **2.3 ISOLATE TPA, Insurgents and Auxiliaries from support bases.**
Concurrent isolation of belligerent groups within Panay from local, regional and
transnational support will deny these groups the ability to remain below the
detection threshold and enable CJTF targeting.

(8) **3.1 EXPOSE TPA destabilising actions.** IOT influence Panay CIVPOP to
expose belligerent groups concealed within their midst, links to TPA shaping and
influencing within Panay are an important platform for the dismantling of
belligerent group support.

(9) **3.2 INFORM Panay CIVPOP of atrocities.** Continual exposure of belligerent
group activities against the Panay CIVPOP and GoB will contribute to the
isolation of subversive elements from the population.

(10) **3.3 ISOLATE TPA, Insurgents and Auxiliaries from Panay CIVPOP.** In
addition to INFORM effects, CJTF must undertake non-kinetic actions to cause
these groups to isolate themselves from the population IOT allow targeting.

```
(11) 3.4 SHAPE TPA, Insurgents and Auxiliaries into CJTF EAs. Once clearly
isolated from Panay CIVPOP, the CJTF needs to shape these groups into a
time and place of its own choosing IOT neutralise them.
```

```
(12) 4.1 ENHANCE Panay authorities. IOT ensure that Panay establishments
have the capabilities required to assume control of Panay, CJTF 667 must
progressively enhance host nation authorities in preparation for transition.
```

```
(13) 4.2 ENHANCE ethnic relations. A significant factor of instability within
Panay is the state of relations between the various ethnic groups. By
improving these relations at the local and national level, CJTF 667 will reduce
a significant threat to Panay ability to maintain control of the population.
```

```
(14) 4.3 PROTECT vulnerable populations within Panay. In concert with
international conventions, treaties and obligations, CJTF 667 must understand
its responsibilities with regard to UNSCR1325, 1612, 1674, 1820 and 2242 in
addition to the culture and values beliefs within Panay society.
```

```
(15) 4.4 PROTECT critical infrastructure within Panay. The legitimacy of
both CJTF667 and GoB will rest on the CJTFs ability to maintain essential
services, utilities and amenities to maintain or return to normal patterns of
life. CJTF 667 must ensure these services are not targeted, collaterally
protected and maintained where possible throughout this operation. That
which is not, must be repaired or replaced as soon as practically possible and
have a minimise military involvement in maintaining function.
```

c. **Approved Target Audiences (TA).** As advised in the Target Directive, Ref
B, the approved CJTF TAs are as follows:

```
(1) TA 1: Government of Belesia (GoB). This TA includes all members of
local, regional and national government in all capacities. The GoB is deemed
critical to the success of OP STEEL SENTINEL as it is the basis for the
implementation of UNSCR 8873 and provides CJTF 667 its legitimacy and
authority.
```

```
(2) TA 2: Panay Civilian Population (CIVPOP). This includes all ethnic
groups collectively IOT build understanding, unity and social cohesion. This
TA will be essential to the success of OP STEEL SENTINEL as it is the they
who must ultimately endorse the GoB and CJTF 667 and comply with Panay
authorities whilst denying foreign and belligerent actor influence within the
community.
```

```
(3) TA 3: Panay local Authorities. This includes all law enforcement (police),
emergency services (fire, rescue, ambulance), security organisations
(customs, sheriff, bailiff) and regulatory arms of government that regulate,
oversee, enforce and maintain rule of law within Panay. A holistic, WoG
approach to the reformation and enhancement of Panay institutions is deemed
critical to the strengthening of the government and the long term restoration
of law and order.
```

(4) **TA 4: NT CIVPOP.** This TA is restricted to those groups within NT IOT
influence support to the NT Government. The degree of public support for NT’s
political position will directly influence the likelihood of military incursion
or TPA employment.

(5) **TA 5: International Civilian Population (INTNPOP).** This TA is restricted
to those groups external to the Belesian Islands IOT influence support to the NT
Government. The degree of public awareness of NT and TPA’s shaping and
influencing actions within the region will directly influence perceptions of
CJTF 667 legitimacy, regional diplomacy and lobbying of the UN, placing
increased political pressure on both TPA and NT.

(6) **TA 6: TPA.** This includes enlisted ranks through to senior command
levels. The TPA poses a significant threat and is likely to deliberately seek
opportunities to escalate its involvement in Panay based on CJTF activities.
CJTF 667 must not present opportunities for TPA to dominate the narrative by
claiming that CJTF 667 is manoeuvring aggressively, must try to influence
peaceful TPA withdrawal from the disputed region and if unsuccessful must
convince the TPA that it cannot win any military contest on either practical or
moral grounds. This is to be further developed into a surrender strategy during
the combat ops phase.

(7) **TA 7: Insurgents.** This includes members through to senior leader levels.
The Insurgents are predominantly from the Visayan People’s Front and are being
used by NT as a force to divide the community, incite violence and promote
propaganda as a platform/screen for subsequent TPA and TPA SF activities. The
chaos and optics that the Insurgents provide NT are essential to NT’s ability to
retain the initiative and maintain the dominant narrative within Panay,
therefore the degradation and dismantling of the Insurgency will present a
significant operational and messaging victory for CJTF 667.

(8) **TA 8: NT Auxiliaries.** This includes interested parties through to
organisers and instigators. The Auxiliaries include privately funded security
firms (such as the Wagner Group) used to provide security to the San Rafael
Mine. The debunking of Auxiliary propaganda and countering of violence and
influencing actions is crucial to establishing a safe political environment for
Panay to work towards the desired end state.

(9) **TA 9: Potential Ethnic Extremist Groups.** The use of revenge and violence
against radical elements of the ethnic community threatens to further exacerbate
ethnic tensions, legitimise the ethnic nationalist agenda and demonise
reconciliation attempts by ethnic leaders. As such, the disarmament,
demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) of the any armed ethnic persons or groups
is critical to the establishment of CJTF and GoB legitimacy.

(10) **TA 10: Government of NT (GoNT).** This includes members of national
government in all capacities. The purpose of CJTF 667 messaging to the GoNT is
to convince the GoNT that the ANZAC coalition cannot be politically or
militarily defeated and is the predominant political and military entity within
the region. This intent is designed to contain TPA’s regional

```
expansion agenda and to demonstrate ANZAC capabilities IOT deter future
aggression towards other Pacific Nations.
```

d. **Approved Operational Themes.** The approved CJTF themes are as follows:

```
(1) CJTF 667 is here at the invitation of the GoB to enforce UNSCR 8873 and to
protect the Panay people.
```

```
(2) The current destabilised situation in Panay is the result of NT intervention and
TPA influences assisted by local radicals.
```

```
(3) Panay’s future rests on dialogue, not violence. All aspects of the Panay
community are encouraged to leave the past behind and move towards a
brighter future together.
```

```
(4) CJTF 667 looks forward to working with the GoB and the Panay people to
restore Panay to prosperity and success.
```

e. **Key Messages.** The key messages aligned with the approved CJTF themes are
as follows:

```
(1) CJTF 667 is here to help. Please work with coalition forces to allow them to
assist the Panay government.
```

```
(2) If you see something, say something; report any suspicious activity to local
authorities. Do not take action yourself.
```

```
(3) Violence is being used to drive Panayians apart; talking between community
groups is the key to the future.
```

```
(4) CJTF 667 looks forward to working with the government and the community
to return life in Panay to normal.
```

```
(5) Do not take up arms or support those that do. Law and order will be restored
and criminal acts will be punished under law.
```

8. **Groupings and Tasks.**

a. **CMO.** CJTF 667 will be supported by CMO from the operational to the
tactical level to plan and conduct PROMOTE, ENHANCE, INFORM and INFLUENCE
actions in support of the force. Additional guidance is contained within
Appendix 1.

9. **Coordinating Instructions**

a. It is incumbent on the Operational Headquarters to ensure adequate control
and support/taskings are organised for the IRCs. The coordination of which
begins with the IRC’s elements meeting in their respective working group and
discuss the issues and progression of their task and effect deliver on their
assigned targets. These targets being assigned from the Joint Prioritised
Integrated Target List as (JPITL) maintained by the Joint Fires and Effects
Coordination Centre (JFECC). The results of which and suggestions for future
targets/effects will be then brought forward by their applicable operations
staff to the Information Operations Work Group (IOWG). The SO2 IO will then
collate the Measures of Performance (MOP) and the Measures of Effectiveness
(MOE) and synchronise them at the Joint Effects Working Group (JEWG). At the
JEWG, staffed by the SO2 JEffects will be the SO2 Joint Fires, intelligence rep,
legal rep, targeting officer and other staff involved in the targeting process.
After the discussions and proposals are advised, these will be brought to the
Joint Effects Target Board (JETB) where the Comd or his delegate will approve
the actions, apportion resources and if required, task elements via Fragmentary
or Task Order (FRAGO for assigned FE or TASKO for resources not found on the
ORBAT) to achieve effects. The times and frequency of these meetings and work
groups will be advise by way of a HQ Battle Rhythm (B2C2WG).

b. IRCs are expected to conduct their own work groups and have a trained staff
member provide inputs and exchange information coherently as the IRCs Subject
Matter Expert (SME). The SME maybe required to attend at the JEWG or to the
COMD’s JETB but should not attend as a regular matter of course. Conversely,
where an order is to be struck for an action or activity, the SME can assist in
drafting the order and give advance warning of the order to their respective IRC
elements.

c. In some cases where the sensitivity of the desired effect or the secrecy
surrounding the chosen target exists, the IRC tactical element may not
necessarily be inform of the higher order impact or the true target for the
desired effect. IRCs are expected to conduct their activities with a minimum of
information and should report all aspects of their task using the communications
chain in accordance with command and signals reporting requirements. Timings for
which are TBA.

d. MOPs and MOEs assist in the accomplishment of the assessment process by
qualifying or quantifying the intangible attributes of the information
environment. The MOP for any one action should be whether or not the TA was
exposed to the IO action or activity. MOEs should be observable, to aid with
collection; quantifiable, to increase objectivity; precise to ensure accuracy;
and correlated with the progress of the operation to attain timeliness.
Indicators are crucial because they aid the joint IO plan in informing MOEs and
should be identifiable and reported on by all IRCs. Information of effects and
measures can be found in Ref E.

**ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS**

10. **Log Arrangements and Resupply**

a. The prudent and general log rule for all IRC tactical teams and elements is
self- sufficiency. When employed in the AO, all IRC elements with teams or
staffs must have their own logistics and transportation resources and be capable
of sustained ops for periods from 72 hrs to 7 days without the need for
resupply. If resupply is required then the parent unit of the IRC team is to
make the necessary arrangements. Contingency plans for emergencies such as break
down, veh recovery or comms failures must be detailed in a units patrol TTPs and
orders.

b. All IRCs with actual tactical elements, will retain responsibility for the
provision of daily sustainment or for organising that resupply with a unit with
control of the AO where the team operates. Where the element is seconded to a
formation HQs for a task, then it is to come under administrative control of the
HQs support unit. Where an element is in location of a forward combat unit then
administrative arrangements may be made with that unit for sustainment. Care
must be used when assigning command and control arrangements while elements are
in a units location or under their responsibility for security. It is expected
that elements may have to provide assistance to a supporting unit and it may
even be necessary for them to be incorporated into the watch routine and
perimeter security plan.

c. The IO staff in the HQs are to become the technical administrative leader for
IRC staff or cells as maybe assigned to the HQs. As such, the IO staff branch of
that HQ are expected to have an administrative officer / NCO capable of sorting
the working and living arrangements of these members whilst attached to the HQs.
These staff should come as self-contained as possible but there is an
expectation that their pers welfare and basic office needs will be meet by the
staff in IO to ensure maximum efficiency of their staff function. However, as
the SME for their IRC, the HQs will have an expectation that special to needs
items such as laptops and software or systems access will be brought with the
SME or sorted out with that staff member prior to assignment.

11. **Tpt Arrangements and Movements.**

a. IRC tactical elements and teams are also expected to come with their own
intrinsic transportation to move them into and around the assigned AO. Where
this transport is not compatible with the organisation assigned or doesn’t meet
the protection or mobility needs of the team, then arrangements detailing the
transportation requirements are to be created and tasked to the forward unit.
This may also include the assignment of security to the team as well. The IRC
teams will be expected to organise veh resupply and light recovery and should a
vehicle require replacement, that IRCs unit remains responsible.

b. Staff assigned as SME to a HQs are to be carried and transported by the HQs
in its vehicles and transport means when the HQ moves. Should a SME arrive with
intrinsic transportation, arrangements should immediately be made for that
vehicles resupply and recovery arrangements. The HQs has responsibility for the
veh but should not expect to have control or use of that resource unless
arrangements can be mutually organised and agreed to.

12. **Admin Support Arrangements**.

a. As for the logistical arrangements, tactical teams remain the responsibility
of their higher IRC organisation for admin support. The exception being health
care. Should a tac team member become a cas, especially in the fwd area, then
they are to enter the chain of evacuation by the best means possible with
consideration given towards their condition and severity.

b. Staff attached to the HQs will be treated as for the arrangements of the
permanent HQs staff.

**OVERVIEW**

1. **General.** This annex details the Civil Military Operations (CMO)
   objectives and activities to be undertaken in support of the land component
   operations. This is to support the establishment of security and stability
   conditions in the JFAO sufficient for the transition of responsibility for
   security to a mandated UN Follow on Force (FoF) and subsequent Host Nation
   Military / Security forces. This annex is to be used by those elements
   involved in Civ- Mil activities and those whom may need to understand the
   Civ-Mil environment for their own BOS. All CMO intentions will be undertaken
   with in IO objectives and in line with the COMD’s intent (here with
   restated);

a. **Purpose**. Enforce UNSCR 8873 to re-establish Belesian sovereignty in Panay
and Palawan.

b. **Method**. Deploy CJTF 667 with enablers from ADF and OGA to the JFAO to
prosecute Multi-Domain Operations against North Torbian elements in Belesian
sovereign territory. Coordinate WOAG and multinational efforts to enforce
UNSCR 8873.

c. **Endstate**. The removal of North Torbian forces from Belesian sovereign
territory, establishment of a safe and secure environment in the occupied
Belesian territories, and conditions set for the UN supervised transition of
authority in Panay and Palawan back to the Belesian Government

**SITUATION**

2. **Enemy**. Analysis of operational environment, threat, threat forces and
   assessment of likely en ops, see Intelligence, OPORD Annex B.
3. **Friendly**. Detailed friendly forces, groupings, tasks and organisation see
   Operations, OPORD Annex C.
4. **Inhabitants**. A detailed social-political and infrastructure summary of
   the JFAO is provided in Ref A to E, and detailed in the enclosed Country
   Study Appendix 1. That study providing the following points as particular
   relevance to the CJTF 667 CMO plan for the Panay Island province of the
   nation state of Belesia:

a. **Population.** The population of Belesia is 109,000,000 based on July 2016
estimates. The pop in Panay is 4,301,000 (2015) which is spread throughout the
island’s urban and rural area with pop centres noted in Panay Map Appendix 2 and
as follows;

```
I-
2
```

```
(1) Kalibo; pop 574,000 capital of province of Aclan supporting 17 smaller towns.
```

```
(2) San Rafael; pop 582,000 capital of province of Antiq supporting 18 towns.
```

```
(3) Roxas; pop 761,000 capital of province of Apiz supporting 16 towns.
```

```
(4) Iloilo City; pop 2,384,000 capital of province of Iloilo supporting 42 towns.
```

b. **Language**. Panay has three official languages, Tok Belesia, Tagalog and
English although Tagalog is seldom used by the younger generations. English is
the language of government, education and business. Tok Belesia, a Melanesian
pidgin similar in nature to Papua New Guinea Tok Pisin and Vanuatu Bislama. It
is the lingua franca. There are a number of indigenous languages spoken which
belong to various linguistic groups. The number of speakers of these languages
has steadily dwindled in recent decades. FE should be able to communicate with
the pop in English, especially the younger people without need of translators.

c. **Culture and Society**. Within Panay there are four ethnic groups, Panayan
48%, Torbian 32%, Olvanan 18%, and European 2%. Within each of these groups a
number of clans or extended family groups exist. Each of these clans
historically operated within a defined territory as noted in Panay Map attached
as Appendix 3, moving throughout their home lands. While a homogeneous and
multicultural population, FE should still exercise caution when dealing with
tribal issues as this is still a strong bond within Panay society.

d. **Religion**. The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) is the major religion in Panay,
being a de facto provider of many public services a more functional government
would ordinarily supply. The RCC has strong and deep roots within most
communities both religious and secular, and its international character has led
to some suspicion that factions within the local cathedral communities might be
partisan actors or at least being logistical links for Olvana and Torbia. The
influence the RCC has over the population, almost 65% are active parishioners,
can not be overstated. A highly religious society means that care must be taken
by the FE to not be seen to be contrary to the church or its symbology.

e. **Politics and Government**. Following the 1967 announcement of the
government to grant Panay self-governance no later than 1972, elections to a
popular assembly were held in

1971. The Panay District Assembly consists of 40 members with 10 members elected
      by each of the 4 districts and is headed by a parliament based out of the
      capital Iloilo City. The government still operates on a small “pay for
      services” scheme to get work done. This is often and incorrectly referred
      to as corruption, but is not. It is the recognised method of getting govt
      work done. This is not to be confused with the graft and payouts done by
      the mining sector of business as this money goes straight to elected
      members and not into the government supply.

f. **Economic outlook.** Successive Panay governments have overseen the
exploitation of the islands natural resources with a light hand, generally
granting concessions, specifically mining, in a resource bidding war that if
successful would see Panay gain high economic benefits. The commercial and
industrial businesses which thrive in Panay have worked out that small wages and
pay offs to politicians can lead to high profit. These commercial interests need
careful handling. The FE can expect that commercial enterprises will be quick

```
I-
3
```

to exploit the situation and it is anticipated that claims and compensation will
be sought as the security circumstances improve.

g. **Electricity.** Panay has a coal fired power generator located on the
outskirts of each of the provincial centres. Power is reasonably well provided
for but suffers from high demand shortages especially during peak periods,
resulting in outages of a few hours. Energy is supplied as 240-250v 60Hz cycle
which is broken into 110-120v in the homes and buildings with power within the
pop. Breakdowns in coal delivery can also disrupt supply sometimes lasting in
outages of days. Critical infrastructure has backup generators but these are
also subject to outage due to disruptions in diesel fuel supply. FE should not
expect to be able to tap into and utilise the civilian electricity grid and must
come self-contained with its own generator power supply and fuel to run it.

h. **Water Supply.** All towns draw their town water from underground aquifers
and the larger rivers which runs through them. The water quality can run from an
A to C rating. Supply during the dry season may also cause shortages. Given the
low quality and lack of quantity, FE must bring its own purification and water
supply systems.

i. **Fuel Supply.** Panay is bisected by the AMADA Natural Gas Pipeline, which
is a significant infrastructure of considerable value to the national Belesian
government. Natural gas is the fuel of choice for the pop needs being used for
everything from cooking to powering vehicles and generators. Fuel supply of both
diesel and petrol is provided from refineries in Belesia which can result in
shortages due to the problems of shipping and distribution. Fuel supplies for FE
will not be possible from inside Panay and CSS & LOG should not plan to get
these from in country with care taken to not cause shortages to the pop.

j. **Waste Treatment**. Regional centres have a rudimentary and inefficient
sewage systems with the more remote areas generally have individual house septic
systems. This has in past caused fouling of the water supply which then causes
health concerns with the pop. The FE needs to be cognisant that its waste
disposal systems and programs do not cause environmental issues nor exacerbate
problems with the existing infrastructure.

k. **Telecommunications**. A high **s** tandard of telephone, mobile phone and
internet connections are available across the whole island and high data
capability available in regional centres. Remote rural areas are for the most
part available with various levels of reliability. It is well known that the
phone infrastructure was built by the MISO Telecom company and that while a
reliable and well used system, can be intercepted and be used as an information
and intelligence source. Phones which use the local system will be subject to
foreign intelligence service information collection activities. It is important
for rebuilding of the country so must be protected from kinetic or non-kinetic
disruption in all phases.

l. **Health.** The island’s civilian health services and support infrastructure,
based on hospitals at the provincial centres. Nationals generally seek treatment
for major medical treatment in Belesia in preference to the Panay health
service. FE should not expect to be able to use the civilian infrastructure and
can expect requests for support when they are located in country.

m. **Legal System.** Justice is administered by the national authority, which
was generally only concerned with serious crimes. Local issues are generally
handled by provincial

```
I-
4
```

magistrates or city judges. Given the CJTF will operate under the provisions of
the UNSCR 8873 and an extant SOFA, FE should have very limited dealings with the
Panay legal system. Legislative issues including the SOFA and ROE are to be
found with the Legal OPORD Annex K.

n. **Policing.** Under national rule, a semi-professional constabulary force of
approximately 100 officers was trained in basic policing skills. Following self
autonomy this small department was expanded and now has some 5,000 members. A
Police Proficiency and Capability report is expected from the AFP on the
competencies and shortfalls of this law enforcement agency. It is to be found
with the Military Police OPORD Annex AD. The expectation is that the countries
police force will return and provide the necessary law enforcement activities on
cessation of hostilities.

o. **Transportation.** Panay has a well-developed, albeit not extensive road
system. Road haulage operations are a key component of the success of the Panay
economy. Care must therefore be exercised by FE to ensure damage to the roads by
either offensive support actions (deliberate or dynamic) or ground force usage,
is kept to a minimum. Where damage occurs, it is to be reported immediately and
repaired as soon as practically possible. The low weight rate (40t
classification) of most highways and bridges will see the use of the roads by
the heavy A veh fleet and larger logistics vehicle fleet severely curtailed.

p. **Humanitarian Situation.** United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator – Panay
**(** UNHC- P) reporting at Ref F estimates approximately 40,000 IDP’s are
scattered throughout Panay as a result of increased activities by the enemy who
have a sophisticated public communications and information operation. These are
moved as the camps reach capacity or if the reason for the displacement ceases.
In most cases, the camps successfully re-integrate the IDPs back to their home
locations.

q. **IDP Camps.** The following IDP camps may have been identified in Panay:

```
(1) Province of Aclan: Two camps; Toora to the east & Minnus adjacent to Kalibo.
```

```
(2) Province of Antiq; Two camps; Casmare and San Rafael.
```

```
(3) Province of Capiz. Three camps; Erine, Ranka and Nurra.
```

```
(4) Province of Iloilo: Two camps; Adland and Iloilo.
```

r. **IDP/Refugees Movements.**

```
(1) Population movement internal of a country produces internally displaced persons
(IDP) but if the population flees across countries borders, they become refugees.
Additional IDP/Refugee movement is expected on commencement of Phase 2 and
additional temporary camps are expected to emerge. These movements are
expected to include both those fleeing active conflict and those who have
benefitted from the supported government and now fear reprisals.
```

```
(2) Greater movements of people combined with an expected deterioration of law &
order and the economy during and immediately after decisive operations are likely
```

```
I-
5
```

```
to exacerbate existing problems within communities. This is likely to have a
particular impact on women with increased incidence of rape, transactional sex
and related gender based violence.
```

```
(3) The maintenance of awareness on the situation of Displaced Persons and
Refugees (DPRE) in the AO will remain a CMO responsibility.
```

```
(4) Upon ceasing of hostilities, security of movement is restored and people feel that
there is sufficient law and order to protect them from attack or retaliation in their
home communities, IDP/refugees will begin to return. This is expected to strain
post-conflict housing availability, public services and food/water supplies.
```

5. **HA and Civil Society Organisations (CSO).**

a. Some of the IO/NGO operating across the CJOA and within Belesia are managing
the IDP camps. It is likely that international and other staffs who work for
IO/NGO may depart or curtail their activities during military operations as they
will conduct their own threat assessments and act IAW the UN Security Level
System.

b. Some CSO are anticipated to be in place to support HA distribution. NGO/IO
will likely determine their own security criteria for entry based on information
from their own sources and the United Nations Department of Safety and Security
(UNDSS). Threat elements will likely attempt to disrupt HA supply and
distribution IOT support their own agenda.

c. Those IOs and NGOs are found in the Panay civil organisations and contact
list attached as Appendix 4.

6. **Civil Assumptions.**

a. Heads of various sections, key stakeholders within the Panay government will
also be based at the capital in Iloilo. Further, other coalition stakeholders
within military and government, NGOs, and other stakeholders such as ICRC will
be based in Iloilo during operations.

b. The Panay people in the occupied area have a neutral position yet positive
sentiment towards the CJTF and aligned Panay Govt.

c. Threat groups will leverage off the CivPop to collect on the CJTF/ADF
activities.

d. Provincial political entities are positive towards Panay Govt and CJTF
elements.

e. Law enforcement aligned with provincial govt are also positive towards Panay
Govt and CJTF elements as well.

f. Medical services and public utilities will deteriorate less than 24hrs of the
commencement of combat operations.

g. National economic aspect of country will deteriorate and will heavily rely on
the informal market and local and provincial economies.

```
I-
6
```

h. Liaison authority to engage with for HN government ministers resides with
CJOPS.

i. IO/NGO will be capable of provision of HA and initial capacity building.

**MISSION**

7. **Purpose**. CMO activities will support the CJTF 667 Mission in order to set
   the conditions for transition of authority to the mandated UN Follow on Force
   (FoF) supported by the international community and to minimise the impact of
   CJTF 667 operations on the civil population.
8. **Method**. CMO will support the CJTF 667 mission by:

a. Undertaking direct comms and liaison, collaboration and interagency planning,
actions and activities with the WOG to set the conditions for transition to the
mandated UN FoF.

b. Supporting the IO objectives, assist in the delivery of key messages to the
local population which prepares them for the return and establishment of the
legitimate Govt of Belesia with an emphasis on our intention to achieve
transition to the UN FoF.

c. Conduct or coordinate those targeted CMO activities on the assigned persons
or groups to achieve the desired effects and outcomes and control those elements
with the JFAO who will interface with the pop.

d. Ensuring that CJTF 667 operations and offensive actions minimise targeted
activities and collateral damage to key civil infrastructure. Where this has not
been achieved, undertake such assessments and organise the repair or replacement
of this damage in as orderly and responsive way as possible.

e. Ensuring that CJTF operations do not create a dependency by the HN population
on CJTF resources.

f. Ensure the avoidance of placing additional strain upon the already fragile
key civil infrastructure including assisting those FE responsible for assisting
the HN Govt depts becoming re-established to provide a return to normality.

g. The provision of appropriately UNCLASS briefs to key stakeholders.

h. Assist with the provision of a secure environment that allows IO/NGO to
deliver services and possible HA to the pop.

i. Coordinating with key agencies regarding IDP/Refugee movement through the
CJOA so agencies are able to establish interim IDP camps if required.

j. Facilitating the provision of Immediate Life Sustaining Aid (ILSA) through
coordination with the On-Site Operational Coordination Centre (OSOCC), Other
Governmental Agencies (OGA), International Organisations (IO) and NGOs.

```
I-
7
```

9. **Endstate.** Set the conditions for the transition of responsibility to the
   mandated UN FoF.

**EXECUTION**

10. **Concept of Operations**.

a. **CMO Elements**. To conduct CMO the following units and force elements will
be utilised for the delivery of effects and provision of Civ-Mil influencing and
informing activities as assigned and directed by the JETB. The lack of coalition
forces, specifically US Mil, means that Civil Affairs (CA) teams are unavailable
for tasking or use.

```
(1) The lack of CA means that the principal CMO tool will be the tactical CIMIC
detachments and teams as provided from the formation CIMIC Group. These
elements will be the priority task for assessments coordination of CMO effects as
tasked to units and FE. It is expected that each Cbt Bde will be provided with its
own CIMIC Tac Spt Tm (TST). The role of CIMIC is to support the mission
through three core functions:
```

```
(a) enhance situational understanding of the civil space.
```

```
(b) support/enhance decision-making, and
```

```
(c) conduct tactical CIMIC tasks as detailed from OPORD.
```

```
(2) Civ Mil Activities (CMA), any unit / sub-unit, elements or staff can be utilised for
activities and duties as tasked through Ops as detailed in TASKORDs from HQs.
This is inclusive of any specialist elements as attached to the formations.
```

```
(3) Civ Mil Liaison (CML) staff for communication and coordination between HQs
and those OGA or HN departments. Any personnel as drawn from staff and
headquarters and may be used and can expect tasking in any or all phases. T hese
would be coordinated through the Info Ops KLE cell staff assisted by the CIMIC
Teams.
```

```
(4) Engineer Assessment Teams for reconnaissance and assessment of infrastructure
and civilian capabilities. May also be required for Engr Civ Asst Program
(ENGCAP) activities in later phases.
```

```
(5) Medical Assessment Teams for assessment and inspection of medical facilities
and population health services. May also be required for Med Civ Asst Program
(MEDCAP) activities in later phases.
```

```
(6) Military Police detachment Engagement Teams for investigations and assessment
of detainee handling infrastructure and civilian capabilities. May also be required
for Police Civ Asst Program (POLCAP) activities in later phases. It will be
expected that a separate and comprehensive hand over of security arrangements
will be specified. See the Military Police, OPORD Annex AD.
```

```
I-
8
```

(7) Female Engagement Teams (FET) or Cultural Support Teams (CST) for engagement
and assessment of the civil situation and population support either from
specialised formed teams or those created for the operation. These teams are not
to be used in the HUMINT role and if they are, must not be additionally tasked
for Civ Mil activities or actions.

(8) Other IO Information Related Capabilities (IRC) units or elements which may
be tasked or accompany the CMO elements as part of an IRC combined effects team.
These may include but are not limited to;

```
(a) The Key Leader Engagement (KLE) cell will have a close relationship with
the CMO elements as they will coordinate much of the interactions between
any FE and those civilian leaders and persons of influence.
```

```
(b) Psychological Operations (PSYOP) teams may also be with CMO elements
to either distribute or provided for delivery that IO product and messages for
those targeted people or groups that any CivMil activities are undertaken.
CMO elements may also be tasked to distribute this product as they meet
with the civilian agencies and individuals allocated to so engage.
```

```
(c) Light Electronic Warfare Teams (LEWT) may accompany CMO elements
as a means of gaining movement within the AO. They may also be there to
provide early warning in the event of hostile activities against FE.
```

```
(d) Public Affairs (PA) officers or teams may also accompany or request
information for input into their products and stories in spt of the FE IO
campaign. They may include Combat Camera members or staff or they may
request imagery as part of CMO activities.
```

```
(e) Those staff which exist in or on the formation HQs which can facilitate civil
engagement either through personal contacts (such as family, educational or
business etc ties), secular contacts, medicinal contacts or any interest
contacts that may provide meeting opportunity.
```

(9) The Dept of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has a special relationship with
defence. It may provide a liaison offr, a Policy Advisor (POLAD) to the higher
headquarters who advises the COMD on strategic issues such as diplomatic
negotiations, demarche exchanges, adherence to agreements such as the Montreaux
document or Ottawa agreement and national policy interpretation. They can not
provide operational or tactical direction nor should they interpose in the
manoeuvre of combat forces.

(10) Interactions with other Civil Agencies. These are defined as those non
military organisations which will exist in the battle space and may be made up
on International Organisations (IOs) such as the UN, ICRC, Amnesty International
etc, Non Government Organisations (NGOs) such as WADE, RAID, FADE, MWC, LoRD
etc, and Other Government Agencies (OGA) such as AFP, DSTO, ABF etc. It is a
misconception that the Military Land Force entrusted with enforcing the UN
mandated actions can also direct or task those civil agencies

```
I-
9
```

```
which are or may soon be present in the JFAO. The military should never task nor
expect that those civ agencies will do the land forces bidding and can only set the
security conditions, which enables them to do the work that they wish to do.
Dialog and open communications must always be sought but influencing or
exploitive actions on behalf of the force is never to be planned. Their neutrality,
impartiality and organisational concern for humanity must always be respected.
```

b. **Scheme of Manoeuvre**. CMO will be conducted across all phases. CJTF 667
CMO elms and those FE tasks with CMO effects will deploy to support CJTF 667
operations during all phases with CTF 667 conducting a handover of CMO
activities to the mandated UN FoF in Phase 5.

```
(1) Ph 0 Shaping. CMO elms conduct initial liaison with key stakeholders, including
HNGovt, OGA and UN OSOCC. Conduct mission planning for the possible
assistance in population movements including the returning of IDP/Refugees.
Participate in the refinement of target lists with Joint Effects and Targeting (JET)
and the provision of information for the KLE engagement strategy.
```

```
(2) Ph 1 Denial. Gain Situational Awareness and Situational Understanding (SASU)
of key civilian and humanitarian issues, threats and opportunities IOT identify
potential CMO activities within the CJOA.
```

```
(3) Ph 2 Lodgement. CJTF 667 J9 will deploy with HQ CJTF 667. J9 will coordinate
initial assistance and response with OGA, OSOCC, IO/NGO. Allocation of CMO
assets throughout the CJOA is as follows:
```

```
(a) CJTF 667 – C9 CMO Dir (O6) and Staff,
```

```
(b) TG 667.2 – J9 CMO PSO (O5), Staff Brch and 1 x TST (-)
```

```
(c) TG 667.2.1 (AS BDE) – 1 x CIMIC TST (26);
```

```
(d) TG 667.2.2 (NZ BDE) – 1 x CIMIC TST (26);
```

```
(e) TG 667.2.3 (AVN BDE) – 1 x CML Tm (from 667.2 TST).
```

```
(4) Ph 3 Neutralise. Refine initial CIMIC assessments and continue Key Stakeholder
Engagement (KSE). Conduct civil engagement with available HN civil authorities.
Facilitate the delivery of key IO messages to local population. BPT facilitate and
control the delivery of ILSA. Coord with OGA, OSOCC, and IO/NGO for the
management of refugees/IDP’s within the AO. In conjunction with OGA and
OSOCC plan and facilitate the restoration of key essential services within
capacity.
```

```
(5) Ph 4 Transition and Redeployment. Conduct handover of all CJTF 667 CMO
activities which will be purposely planned and undertaken to NOT build in
dependencies, to other agencies and the mandated UN FoF.

12. **Coordinating Instructions.**

a. **Stabilization Aid Funds/Commanders’ Emergency Relief Program (SAF/CERP).**
CJTF 667 currently does not have an allocation of funding to implement Consent
Winning Activities (CWA) and Quick Impact Projects (QIP). A request for funding
has been sent to HQJOC and further details will be released by FRAGO.

b. **Compensation Claims.** All civilian claims for compensation are to be
investigated at the command level prior to submission to the HQ CJTF 667 J06.
Commanders are not authorized to agree to pay compensation claims. Further
information is found in the Legal Annex to the OPORD.

c. **Locally Employed Civilians (LEC).** Opportunities will exist for
contracting LEC to fulfil certain functions in support of CJTF 667 efforts and
base support plans. The employment of LEC is to consider the effect upon the
integrity of local community structures and delivery of essential services.
Formation S9 staff are to ensure coordination with HQCJTF 667 J9 Main during LEC
employment planning phase. Guidance on payment rates is TBI. HQCJTF 667 J9
approval is required to employ LEC from: Police, Fire, Ambulance, Border
Protection, Education Dept, Water Dept or Health Dept. This also includes
specialists e.g. police/teachers and administrators.

d. **Operations Assessment (OA).** All CMO reporting including SITREPs, Incident
Reports, CMO SITREPS and Quicklook Storyboards will be utilised in support of
the CJTF 667 OA process.

e. **Request for Assistance (RFA).** The following procedures are to be used for
RFA planning and execution:

```
(1) In the first instance formations are to ensure civilian agencies maximize use of
their resources (either integral or contracted) before accepting RFA for
consideration.
```

```
(2) Formations are authorized to execute RFA as long as they do not prejudice the
CJTF 667 mission and can be executed within formation capabilities.
```

```
(3) RFA that require external support are to be passed through CJTF 667 J9 for
assessment, coordination and de-confliction with other civilian agencies and CJTF
resources.
```

f. **Humanitarian Standards for Encampment Site Selection and Operation.** CJTF
667 will not be responsible for establishing IDP or refugee camps.
Responsibility for the establishment of IDP/refugee camps resides with the UN
humanitarian community. However,

```
I-
14
```

CJTF 667 may be required to support the movement and route security if requested
by the IO / NGOs through the OSOCC.

g. **CMO Measures of Effect.** There must also be continuous assessment of the
civil dimension in order to determine measures of effectiveness (MOE) and the
progress of the mission. This ongoing assessment task is performed by CIMIC
assessment teams and monitored by the CMO staff. MOE refer to observable,
preferably quantifiable, subjective indicators that an activity is proceeding
along a desired path. A commander uses MOE to determine whether an operation is
succeeding in achieving the goals of the operation according to the mission. MOE
should be developed as a product of mission analysis. MOE will differ for every
mission and for different phases of a mission. As the commander and staff
identify specified, implied, and critical tasks, they should define what
constitutes successful completion of each task. They decide how the MOE will be
identified, reported and validated. They determine what action will be taken
when the MOE is achieved, as well as contingency plans in case MOE are not
achieved according to the original plan. MOE are not necessarily fixed and can
be adjusted as the situation changes. See appendix 7.

h. **CMO Normality Indicators**. Normality Indicators (NI) serve to measure
trends and progress in the recovery of a civil society to an improved quality of
life. NI measure the level of development of the civilian condition to reduce
the level of dependency on the military force by the civil population and civil
authorities. Data should be objective, quantifiable and collected
systematically. The force commander must exploit all sources of data measuring
the quality of life and recovery of the local population in the JFAO, as well as
the effectiveness of military operations that assist in this recovery. Direct
and indirect MOE and NI should be jointly developed with civilian agencies to
reinforce unity of purpose and effort in civil– military activities. It is the
interface with the civilian sector that provides the means for collecting data
that contributes to normality. NI should be SMART (specific, measurable,
attainable, results oriented and time based), objective and comparable from
occasion to occasion. Measuring only that which is easily measured, will give a
false impression. Robust information management systems are required to support
the delivery of worthwhile MOE and NI. See appendix 8.

**ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS**

13. **Civilian Resource Requirements**. Arrangements will be required to provide
    a minimum of one APOD/SPOD access to the AO which must remain serviceable,
    with apron or wharf space, to be provided to IO/NGO for delivery of HA.
    Ideally, this will be a separate facility from the military. It should come
    complete with its own aircraft / vessel handling and refuelling facilities
    as well as transport facilities for loading cargo.
14. **Military Resource Requirements.**

a. **ILSA** Immediate Life Sustaining Assistance is defined as the provision of
small scale emergency supplies and services which are needed as a matter of
extreme urgency (in- extremis) to save life or to prevent serious suffering. The
provision of ILSA may be conducted without approval from CJTF 667 HQ where it
can be provided within formation resources and or capability. In the main, ILSA
comprises the provision of water and food however, depending on the
circumstances it may also include; shelter, medical assistance (life, limb or
eyesight), transport, rescue and repair of essential infrastructure. ILSA should
be

```
I-
15
```

provided at ‘arms length’ whenever possible with the direct distribution to
beneficiaries undertaken by IO/NGO, HN agencies, CSO, village or tribal leader.
Direct distribution of ILSA by CJTF FE should only be undertaken in-extremis and
as a last resort. could be sourced from CJTF 667 supply chain. ILSA stocks will
be made available to CJTF 667 formations from Ph 2 for emergency distribution to
the population as required. Provision of ILSA should be in response to immediate
and life threatening requirement and should not displace any current
arrangements in place by NGOs. Under no circumstances should ILSA become the
main source of provisioning for the population.

b. **Bottled Water.** Water (bulk or by 5, 10 or 20 litre military jerry can)
**is not** to be provided for from CJTF log stocks. Commercially procured
plastic 5 or 10 litre collapsible water containers in either blue or clear
colour and bottled drinking water may be authorised where thirst may become the
possible cause of death within the population. It will be carried in unit A and
B Ech in sufficient bulk quantities and provided for upon auth from the unit
Comd. Water for bathing/cleaning will **not** be provided.

c. **Foodstuffs.** Military rations / CRP **is not** to be provided for from
CJTF log stocks. Limited quantities of HUMRAT prepacked high energy supplements
may be available and are to be used only as a means of having an immediate
relief of starvation. It will be carried in unit A and B Ech in sufficient bulk
quantities and provided for upon auth from the unit Comd.

d. **Shelter.** Shelter **is not** to be provided for unless it is necessary to
provide an immediate life sustaining assistance. FE tentage or canvas,
especially that which is easily identified as military (coloured green, brown or
camouflaged) must never be used to provide shelter to the population. Where
shelter is required to protect from the elements it must be of a civilian
pattern, coloured blue or white and set up away from any possible military
associated facilities. Blue tarpaulins, poles and cordage will be carried in
formation B Ech in sufficient bulk quantities and provided for upon auth from
the formation Comd.

e. **Medical**. Medical care and use of med supplies is to be strictly limited
and is only to be used in those extreme cases where life, limb or eyesight is in
danger of being lost. The application of med supplies is to be limited to those
members of the FE who are trained and can provide the necessary care and support
given the conditions as found in the JFAO. Civilians who enter the chain of
evacuation due to FE actions, must be turned over to the civil authority at the
earliest opportunity. The SMO or J07 will provide the necessary decision making
arrangements with the formation Comd.

f. **Trans portation**. Pop movement and transportation is **not** to be done
utilising any military vehicle of the CJTF. Pop movement is to be carried out
with civilian pattern vehs and should be made off of the designated MSR. Should
a requirement exist to provide life sustaining transport then the use of clearly
identified ambulances / medevac ac may be requested. The auth of this will
require Formation Comd approval. Under no circumstances should A vehs or
armoured veh ambulances be used.

g. **Rescue**. Any requirement to facilitate any rescue should only be
undertaken where life is in danger or the pop was forced into a position of
requiring rescue owing to the unintended consequences of FE activities. Rescue
may be required where the pop has, in moving out of the way of FE manoeuvre,
inadvertently become entrapped in the obstacles or minefields of either side.
Such rescue activities will require the unit Comds approval and may extend to
the

```
I-
16
```

use of CJTF resources such as breaching and mine detection eqpt but done only
after the area has been secured and cleared of en threat. The rescue activities
are only to be undertaken after the force has achieved its assignment and any
rescue effort must not impede the military mission.

h. **Maintenance**. Any requirement to complete work on civilian infrastructure
such as; power generators and electricity lines, water pumps, filtration units
and distribution systems, sewage and sanitation works, and medical / education
facilities may only be undertaken if;

```
(1) The damage to these facilities were a result of FE actions or fires,
```

```
(2) The damage is to public facilities and not private or commercial interests,
```

```
(3) The maint undertaken is sufficient to render serviceability and not surpass the
normal standard for the area or facilities.
```

```
(4) That works has been tasked via the CMO / CIMIC team as part of the Effects
battle rhythm, approved by the Comd and detailed as an OPS FRAGO or TASKO.
```

**COMMAND AND SIGNAL**

15. **CMO Coordinating and Liaison Architecture.** TECHCON will be established
    by HQ CTF 667 J9 from Ph 1 to all CJTF 667 Bde S9 staff to assist in overall
    coordination of CMO activity and allocation of resources. CJTF 667 J9 will
    establish comms to the CJTF CMOC in DWN. CJTF 667 J9 will remain in loc with
    HQ CJTF 667 for all phases.
16. **Reports and Returns.** All CJTF 667 Bde S9 are to ensure daily CMO SITREP
    is compiled and forwarded to HQ JTF 667 JOR NLT 2100H daily. The format for
    the CMO SITREP is at Appendix 5. Significant CIMIC contacts are to be
    recorded as CHATREPS and forwarded on completion NLT 12h following contact.
    Layout is noted at Appendix 6.
17. **Communications.** CMO elements requiring interactions with the HN Govt, UN
    Agencies or IO/NGOs must come complete with civilian mobile phones, network
    data devices and civilian means laptop computers to be able to effectively
    pass and collect information from these sources. As a minimum, elements must
    have the following communications means;

a. Civ Telecom land line phone with answering device and facsimile capabilities.
These may need to be source in country given the power supply incompatibility
with the AS power system.

b. Civ Mobile phones for voice, text, and NGO chat app usage. The SIM cards must
be sourced in country and care must be exercised given the FIS collection
capabilities within that system.

c. CIMIC PC laptops with non military email accounts as established prior to in
country operations. These can be connected to the data communications system via
network devices but will also require local telecom data network SIM cards. This
LAN system is to have

```
I-
17
```

backup capability and multifunction device capability to allow printing and
scanning of documents and IO products.

d. Those CMO elements should also come with a number of civilian two way hand
held radios compatible with those used by NGOs and must have a charging
capability for those power packs.

e. Elements must come with or be provided with, Military PRR and MBTR radios for
internal sigs and patrol comms. SOIs and CEOIs to be provided from the HQs
elements.

COUNTRY BRIEF (DRAFT FRAMEWORK)
```

BACKGROUND

1. The island of Panay was formerly a possession of the Skolkan Empire along
   with Palawan, Cebu, Negros, and Bohol. After the empire’s collapse in the
   early 20th century, Panay declared independence but was subsequently absorbed
   into the Belesian Federation after a period as a protectorate of Torrike,
   former seat of the Skolkan Empire. Panay’s two main population centres are
   Roxas in the north and Iloilo in the south. Panay is also home to the San
   Rafael Cerium mine, where one of the world’s few concentrated rare earth
   mineral deposits is located. Since its shift from gold ore extraction to
   Cerium mining, San Rafael has both created opportunities and exacerbated
   local ethno-social tensions as well as becoming a focus of regional power
   competition.
2. Panay has never been a willing member of the Belesian Federation being
   culturally distinct owing to its history of Skolkan influence. Over the
   years, strong separatist sentiment has periodically escalated into violent
   revolt, a frequent and costly irritant for the Belesian government. Despite
   this, they have been loth to grant independence, partly from unwillingness to
   compromise the territorial integrity of their young state, and partly owing
   to the revenues generated by the San Rafael mine. These tensions culminated
   in the 1972 massacre of some one hundred and forty four during ethnic clashes
   with the Belesian paramilitary police officers. This event, dubbed “The Ash
   Wednesday Massacres”, resulted in Panay being granted autonomous home rule.
   Relations between the local Panay government and Belesian central authorities
   have yet to be normalised, and Ash Wednesday has become a frequent catchcry
   for separatist elements in Panay.
3. Panayan internal politics are no less fraught. The mine, which is integral to
   the local economy, is largely worked by Torbian immigrants who have to some
   extent monopolised mining employment on the island. While the mine itself is
   owned by Panay (and therefore nominally by Belesia), much of the plant and
   infrastructure was acquired through Olvanan investment. The Torbian immigrant
   population is the most sizeable ethnic minority, making up some 32% of the
   island’s total population, having arrived in Panay shortly after WWII as
   indentured labour for the San Rafael mine during its gold extraction period.
   A small Olvanan diaspora, mainly concentrated in Roxas around Olvanatown and
   the recently established Olvanan trade mission set up to safeguard Olvanan
   interests in San Rafael, is the next largest ethnic minority. The remaining
   bulk of the island’s population identify as Panayan.

ETHNIC GROUPS

4. Panayan: The Panayan people share a common heritage with the broader Belesian
   population, but are culturally distinct. This is partly owing to their
   position near the Western hinterland of the archipelago which has a high
   concentration of unmixed indigenous tribes, but is mostly to do with the fact
   that Panay is majority Christian, the island having been largely insulated
   from the spread of Islam through the region in the 15th century by Skolkan

```
I-
19
```

rule. This has led to significant differences in culture, custom, and world view
between the inhabitants of Panay and the rest of the Belesian Federation. The
majority of Panayans feel marginalised by the majority Islamic Belesian state,
and despite a heavy Christian presence within the Belesian military, the
Christians of Panay feel disadvantaged and sometimes persecuted by their Muslim
neighbours. This disaffection has allowed the Visayan People’s Front (VPF), a
separatist Christian armed insurgent group, to maintain a strong presence on the
island.

5. Torbian: The Torbian diaspora has a long history in Belesia in general and
   Panay in particular, many Belesians having mixed Torbian ancestry. The
   Torbian population on Panay, however, has failed to integrate into Panayan
   society. Given their size, making up one third of the local population,
   Torbians on Panay have been a largely self-sustaining, self-referential
   community. While their original status as indentured labour is no longer in
   effect, the Torbians on Panay remain an underclass, being economically
   disadvantaged even relative to the high levels of youth and rural poverty in
   the region, and driven into insularity by periodic racial scapegoating over
   their long history on the island. This has led to the Torbian population
   demonstrating unusually high levels of ethnic tribalism, which acts to drive
   a further wedge between them and the indigenous population of Panay.
6. Olvanan: The Olvanan diaspora in Belesia possesses disproportionate social
   and economic power, and the Olvanan minority on Panay is no exception.
   Despite making up only a small percentage of Panay’s population, Olvanans own
   a sizeable chunk of the island’s wealth and are significantly overrepresented
   within the island’s educated, business and property owning middle class. This
   has led to a long history of mistrust and resentment between the Panayan and
   Olvanan populations, not helped by the history of antagonism between their
   two nations. These tensions have been further exacerbated by the recent
   upsurge in Olvanan activity on the island, the Olvanan government having
   invested heavily in roads, ports, and other mine related infrastructure. This
   investment has come at the cost of punishing royalties and loan repayments
   overseen by the recently established Olvanan trade mission in Roxas. The
   mine, Olvanatown, and especially the trade mission have become symbolic
   targets for Panayan resentment of the far more prosperous Olvanan minority.

POLITICAL AND SECURITY — INTERNAL

7. The autonomous government of Panay is a small, beleaguered, and highly
   corrupt institution with a poor record in delivering services, especially to
   the Torbian community centred on the San Rafael mine. Poor governance and
   lack of interest has resulted in the Panayan government having little to no
   monopoly of force outside Roxas and Iloilo. The tense nature of relations
   with Belesia has meant that not only has the BF been extremely unwilling to
   involve itself in Panayan affairs at any level, it has also resulted in the
   island being effectively cut off from services and other benefits available
   to Federation members. Conversely, significant revenues from the San Rafael
   mine flow out to the BF government as part of the home rule agreement, and
   this has led to increased levels of resentment amongst Panayans towards the
   rest of Belesia. This coupled with the memory of The Ash Wednesday Massacres
   has made the Belesian authorities deeply reluctant to intervene overtly in
   Panayan affairs.
8. The Roman Catholic Church is a major player in Panay, being a de facto
   provider of many services a more functional government would ordinarily
   supply. The RCC has strong

```
I-
20
```

and deep roots within most Panayan communities both religious and secular, and
its international character has led to some suspicion that factions within the
local cathedral communities might be partisan actors or at least logistical
links for Olvana and Torbia.

9. Given the marginalisation of the Torbian population on Panay, the Torbian
   community has become largely self-sufficient in terms of service delivery and
   security. Localised committees organise essential services such as garbage
   collection and education, and what little policing and security which exists
   is administered via small localised militias formed from past and present
   private security contractors hired either by the Olvanan trade mission or the
   historical owners of the mine. This has led to what is effectively a Torbian
   enclave in the immediate environs of the mine, with smaller satellite
   enclaves existing in the major population centres.
10. The Olvanan trade mission represents a syndicate of Olvanan SOEs which,
    between them, own the major port facilities in both Roxas and Iloilo, the
    main trunk roads linking these ports with the San Rafael mining complex, and
    large gated precincts in Roxas, Iloilo, and San Rafael in which technical
    and trade personnel, mostly Olvanans, are housed. They also have major
    interests in the power distribution and generation networks and
    telecommunications infrastructure of Panay. This unusually heavy level of
    investment arises from the fact that the San Rafael mine makes up a
    significant percentage (12%) of Olvana’s total rare earth metal inflows, the
    securing of which is a key Olvanan strategic goal. The segregated nature of
    the Olvanan footprint, and the relative prosperity of Olvanans in Panay, is
    a major source of tension and conflict.
11. Given Panay’s position near the western extremity of Belesia, the island has
    always acted as a throughpoint for regional licit and illicit trade. Crime
    levels in Belesia are considered high, and Panay is no exception. The
    principle criminal enterprises involve smuggling of people, goods, and/or
    illicit drugs. Local crime syndicates, Olvanan Black Societies, and the
    Tantoco Cartel are highly active in the region. The traffic in drugs,
    uncustomed goods, and labour slaves (mostly Torbian) is estimated to be
    worth over $XX billion dollars per annum. It can sometimes be difficult to
    disambiguate Olvanan and Panayan criminal organisations from legitimate
    centres of power, especially at a local level.
12. The Visayan People’s Front is a Christian separatist insurgent militia
    committed to establishing an independent entity composed of the islands of
    Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. Whilst the Panayan government is not one
    hundred percent aligned with their goals, there is sufficient crossover,
    especially with regard to ethno-religious commonalities, to make the
    relationship between Panayan authorities and the VPF highly ambiguous.
    Additionally, given the general poverty of the island and its role in
    illicit trade routes, the VPF has developed a significant degree of
    interoperability with local and Olvanan criminal syndicates, often turning
    to smuggling and piracy for fundraising purposes. Along with the heavy
    presence of Wagner Group PMCs, VPF militants are frequently used as armed
    security for various criminal and even some legitimate groups across Panay.
13. The Wagner Group has a heavy footprint in Panay. The general inability of
    government to maintain law and order unaided, combined with the Wagner Group
    being the principal contractor providing security for the Olvanan SOEs
    associated with the San Rafael mine, means that Wagner Group PMCs are a
    significant armed body existing within the security matrix of the island of
    Panay. Given that most Wagner Group operatives in the region are of

```
I-
21
```

Torbian descent, there is significant crossover between the Torbian immigrant
community and Wagner Group personnel.

14. The Red Tigers Black Society is a major link in the illicit trade route that
    runs through access points north and south of Palawan, as well as elsewhere.
    The Red Tigers are suspected to be in direct competition with the Tantoco
    Cartel for control of the arms, drugs, and people trafficking markets within
    the region. The leadership of the Red Tigers is unknown, but given the
    general character of the group, their head is thought to be a member of the
    Olvanan community.
15. The Tantoco Cartel is the second of the large transnational criminal
    organisations operating in the area, with significant suspected drug and
    weapons markets within and around the San Rafael mine and Torbian workers’
    ghetto. Their leadership is also unidentified, but strong suspicions rest on
    the local police department. It is also thought that the Tantoco Cartel is
    the vector for most Wagner Group recruitment which occurs off island.

POLITICAL AND SECURITY — EXTERNAL

16. The Local Panayan Government has a UN mandate for independence, but is in
    reality a semi-autonomous member of the Belesian Federation. This
    complicates Panay’s external security situation, creating a triangle effect
    between Panay, Belesia, and the external power in question.
17. At this point in time, Belesia is embroiled in an EEZ dispute with
    neighbouring South Torbia, a major aspect of which concerns the San Rafael
    mine. This has led to a number of minor cross maritime border incidents
    between Panay/Belesia and South Torbia.
18. Belesian relations with Olvana, a regional hegemon within easy reach, are
    highly complex. On the one hand, Olvanan investment is eagerly sought after
    by all of the islands of the Belesian Federation, including and especially
    Panay. On the other hand, however, the strategic interests of the two
    nations often clash, and Olvana and Belesia are currently embroiled in
    maritime territorial disputes, both nations frequently conducting
    provocative FONOPS. Panay itself is increasingly at odds with Olvana over
    what is perceived to be Olvana’s rapacious financial exploitation of the San
    Rafael mine.
19. Belesia’s relationship with the small island nation of Gabal is described as
    good. Gabal’s neutrality and relative unimportance help to facilitate this.
20. In the broader region, North and South Torbia are experiencing a periodic
    cooling of their perennial conflict. This has freed South Torbia to pursue
    its other claims and disputes and is the cause of South Torbia’s current
    intense focus on its disputes with Belesia/Panay. Belesia is one of the few
    nations which has cordial relations with North Torbia.
21. Olvana’s expansionist strategy has ruffled the feathers of many of its
    regional neighbours, including Belesia and South Torbia, but there is little
    expectation at present of these tensions leading to a major conflict in the
    immediate future. Having said that, Olvanan military activity has ramped up
    significantly over recent years. At present, Olvana and North Torbia are
    currently conducting Ex RISEN SWORD, a biannual interoperability and

```
I-
22
```

cooperation exercise, in the South China Sea west of Palawan Island and just
outside Belesia’s EEZ.

22. Belesia has generally good relationships with the US and its allies,
    specific economic or territorial disputes aside. At present, there is a high
    level of information and personnel exchange between the Belesian military
    and western powers active in the region including Australia, New Zealand,
    and the USA. Panay itself maintains close ties with Torrike, though these
    are generally considered to consist more of a sense of historical kinship
    rather than any more tangible relationship of exchange.

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: ZULU.**

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of CJTF 667 OPORD 01 (Ref A) and
Annex B - Intelligence.

b. General. The Joint Force Logistic Component Command (JFLOGCC) is a Component
Command under CJTF 667. The JFLOGCC role is to provide and coordinate intimate
logistic support to all CJTF 667 component commands in order to prosecute the
strategic and operational objectives of Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS).

c. Purpose. The purpose of this Logistic Support Order is to provide a support
framework for CJTF 667. CJTF 667 will be supported by the JFLOGCC, concentrating
in the primary APOD in General Santos City. This Support Order also includes
support to Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) and Host Nation (HN) requirements
when they fall under CJTF 667 control.

d. Operational Areas.

```
(1) Joint Force Area of Operations (JFAO). The JFAO includes the landmasses, national
air space and territorial waters of Belesia (BX), the Sulu Sea, parts of the Celebes Sea,
the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The landmass, airspace and territorial
waters of Gabal (GX) and South Torbia (RT) remain neutral and are excluded from the
JFAO.
(2) Primary APOD. General Santos International Airport, General Santos City, BX.
(3) Alternate APOD. Colonel Edwin Andrews Airbase, Zamboanga, BX.
(4) Primary SPOD. Makar Wharf, General Santos City, BX.
(5) Alternate SPOD. Zamboanga Port, BX.
(6) JFLOGCC Area of Operations (AO). The JFLOGCC AO is comprised of the
landmass, airspace and territorial waters (12NM) of BX and the sea/air lanes linking
the primary APOD/SPOD within the JFAO and the designated NSB hub of Darwin.
```

e. Terrain and Man-Made Features. See the BX Country Study (Ref B).

```
R-2/7
```

f. Host Nation Considerations

```
(1) As an island nation, BX relies on a network of regular maritime ferry and domestic air
services to move personnel and freight amongst its various islands. Typically, the
maritime ferry services are the primary means of inter-island transportation. BX road
networks on the larger islands are mainly paved. However, there are numerous
unimproved dirt and gravel roads throughout the area, especially on the smaller
islands, or islands with a small population. Rural roads do not receive proper
maintenance, leaving them susceptible to damage from the weather and neglect. The
monsoonal season also has a drastic effect on the inland roads with communities at
times being cut off and isolated during severe weather. BX is currently constructing a
railway network in Mindanao, connecting all the major cities, but will not see
operational service for at least another 5 years. There is a nascent railway connecting
the cities of Iloilo and Roxas on Panay, but has not seen operations since 1985.
(2) Most of the region, particularly rural areas, cannot access all modern utilities such as
potable water, electricity, and modern sewage systems. This will cause a reliance on
military electrical, water and sanitation systems.

2. **Mission.** JFLOGCC will provide logistic support to CJTF 667 and Component
   Commands IOT sustain operations for the duration of Operation STEEL SENTINEL.
3. **Execution.**

a. COMD JFLOGCC Intent.

```
(1) Purpose. To ensure that all CJTF 667 components are provided with sufficient logistic
support to enable the completion of operations in support of CJTF 667 objectives.
(2) Method. Reception and staging (RSO&I) activities will be coordinated by Joint Force
Reception Centres (JFRC) located in the Primary and Alternate APOD/SPOD, in
conjunction with the Joint Movements Coordination Cell (JMCC) and supported by
the National Support Base (NSB) and ADF assets. Once deployed in the JFAO,
logistic support will be provided along national and component lines with integral and
close support assets being embedded within all components. The JFLOGCC will
provide general support to those FE located within the APODs/SPODs through the
Force Support Group (FSG) and the Joint Contract Management Cell (JCMC). The
JFLOGCC HQ will have a live logistics cell providing oversight of general common
user logistics support being provided by its subordinate organisations to all CJTF 667
FE. AS will provide sustainment support for classes I (fresh rations and bulk water
only), II (AS camp stores only), III, IV, VI, VII, and X. Sustainment of TCN specific
class II, and classes V and IX will be provided along national lines. Administrative
and logistic support will be provided IAW the following phases:
```

```
R-3/7
```

(a) Phase 0: Shaping (D-60 – D-11). Staging into the JFAO. Main effort will be
the deployment of FE and the provision of enabling support to RSO&I activities
coordinated by the JFRCs, JMCC and components. Additional tasks include:

1. Reception and personnel tracking.
2. Movement of FE, equipment and stores from NSB to the staging APODs/SPODs.
3. Prepositioning of fuel and Explosive Ordnance (EO) stocks where required.
4. Provision of casualty regulation, Role 2 health facilities and support to
   Rotary Wing (RW) Aero-Medical Evacuation (AME).

(b) Phase 1: Denial (D-10 – D-1). This phase will see the sustainment of
decisive action occurring with maritime and air operations establishing control
of critical air and sea lanes within the JFAO. In conjunction with sustaining
the maritime and air offensive operations, the supporting effort will continue
to stage other FE into the JFAO. Additional logistic tasks include:

1. The provision of real life support to FE.
2. Bulk storage and distribution of classes I, III, and V.
3. Management of local support contracts.
4. Provision of casualty regulation, Role 2 health facilities and support to RW
   AME.
5. Personnel training and reporting.

(c) Phase 2: Lodgement (D-Day – D+2). This phase will see the lodgement of
ground forces into the contested island of Panay. Logistic support will continue
to be provided through organic and embedded logistic units within each
component. Main effort will be the preparation for forward push of critical
class I, III and V stores into Panay through an APOD/SPOD as soon as possible
and also through Logistics Over The Shore (LOTS) operations with the JFMCC ATG.

(d) Phase 3: Neutralise (D+3 – D+14). This phase will see decisive action on the
island of Panay to defeat the North Torbian Forces. Main effort for JFLOGCC
during this phase will be the forward ‘push’ of class I, III, and V stores to
land FE. A secondary landing of FE into Palawan will require logistic support
during this phase.

(e) Phase 4: Transition (D+15 onwards). This phase will see the redeployment of
FE to home locations in a staged manner. This phase will also include the
finalization of all logistic support arrangements and reconstitution of all FE.
Provision of enabling support to reverse RSO&I activities coordinated by the
JFRCs, JMCC and the components. The JFLOGCC will also need to be prepared to
support stability operations should CJTF 667 transition to peacekeeping.
Additional tasks include:

1. Cleaning of stores and equipment.
2. EO remediation.

```
R-4/7
```

3. Personnel tracking of departing FE.
4. Continued provision of casualty regulation, Role 2 health facilities and
   support to RW AME. (3) Endstate. Administrative and logistic support has been
   provided to ensure the successful completion of all CJTF 667 objectives. All
   CJTF 667 FE will have redeployed back to home locations.

b. Logistic support statement by Component. Logistic support to components will
be characterized by the following:

```
(1) JFMCC. HQ JFMCC will be located at the APOD in Zamboanga, BX. Maritime units
are to deploy with sufficient stocks to meet OVP requirements IAW single Service and
national guidance. The provision of logistic support services will occur through a
combination of Replenishment at Sea (RAS), coalition mutual logistic support, direct
support from logistic nodes in the JFAO, dedicated shore-based RW support and local
contractual arrangements with the HN.
(2) JFLCC. HQ JFLCC will be co-located with HQ CJTF 667 at the APOD, General
Santos City, BX. The major JFLCC elements will be the X AS Cbt Bde, the X NZ Cbt
Bde, the X AS Avn Bde, and Divisional Troops. The bulk of the JFLCC will stage out
of the APOD at General Santos City. Some JFLCC FE will be embarked aboard the
Amphibious Task Group (ATG) during Ph 1 and 2. The JFLCC concept of support is:
(a) FE will deploy with integral medical (Role 1) and logistic support assets.
(b) Close logistic support will be provided by X Combat Service Support Battalion (X
CSSB).
(c) General health support will be provided by the deployable Role 2 Enhanced (Role
2E) health assets (more detail covered in Ref D).
(d) General support will be provided to the JFLCC through the Force Support Group
(FSG).
(e) Class V is to be provided along national lines and positioned at the Ammunition
Supply Point (ASP) established in the APOD at General Santos City, BX.
(3) JFACC. HQ JFACC (and CAOC) is located with HQJOC and is supported logistically
under extant arrangements. The CTUs under JFACC are based by APOD location;
Zamboanga and General Santos City, BX, and Darwin, AS. JFACC FE will deploy
with integral logistic support elements. Close support will be provided at each base.
General support will be provided by an expeditionary Combat Support Element
(Squadron) allocated to each base. The Combat Support Elements deployed to
Zamboanga, BX will also establish a Role 2 Enhanced field hospital.
(4) SOTG. The SOTG HQ will be located at the APOD, General Santos City, BX. SOTG
will deploy with integral close logistic support. General logistic support will be
supported by onsite logistic elements from the JFLOGCC.

```

c. Groupings. See Annex A for the C2 construct.

d. Mortuary Affairs. CJTF 667 will retain full jurisdiction of AS personnel.
Mortuary Affairs for TCN will fall under NSE/NCE jurisdiction after processing
from the closest R2E. Only in exceptional circumstances, such as contamination
of remains, will emergency or temporary burial in the JFAO will be authorised.
If such is required, all attempts must be made to contact CJTF 667 J1 prior to
burial taking place. Enemy casualties are to be treated IAW national policy and
compliant with Geneva Conventions Article 17. Enemy casualties may be properly
interred on site or gathered for burial at collection points as designated by
component/formations. In all cases, any articles of identification must be
collected and returned through the J1 along with records to include burial
location and description of the means used to mark the grave(s). Further details
are included in Appendix 4.

e. Replacements. Whilst OSS is not expected to last long enough to require
replacements beyond the UN mandate of 12 months, any replacements for personnel
will be a national responsibility.

f. Religious service. National responsibility taking into consideration local
and Host Nation sensibilities.

g. Salvage. Salvage operations are a national responsibility.

h. Repair, Recovery and Back-loading. Repair, recovery and back-loading of
equipment will be a national responsibility. JFLOGCC will have a limited
capacity to assist in the rearward movement of equipment.

```
R-6/7
```

i. Contracting. The JCMC will be responsible for all CJTF 667 contracts with
local HN services. All requirements for contracting support are to be routed
through the appropriate Component Commands to the JFLOGCC JCMC. TCN NSE may
conduct their own HN contracting arrangements, but are highly encouraged to
align with JCMC efforts.

j. Distribution. Distribution will be provided through a combination of ADF, TCN
and contracted assets across the JFAO, primarily by maritime, but using road and
air assets as appropriate.

```
(1) Inter-theatre distribution. Distribution between the NSB and the agreed points
identified below will primarily utilise contracted distribution assets. ADF distribution
capabilities may be utilised when appropriate.
(2) Intra-theatre distribution. Distribution from the agreed point and the JFAO is to be
under JFLOGCC arrangements through HQJOC.
(3) Agreed Points. The Agreed Point for all personnel and materiel into the JFAO will be
through the APOD/SPOD, General Santos City, BX.
```

k. Diplomatic clearances / customs. Diplomatic clearances will be IAW the SOFA
in Ref E. TCN may utilise the umbrella provided under Ref E as part of CJTF 667,
or establish their own exchange of letters with BX.

l. Postal. Free post will be made available for all CJTF 667 mail between the
JFAO and AS. An AFPO will be established by the JFLOGCC at the APODs, with mail
to be serviced through service air / contracted flights and then further

**Overview**

1. This appendix provides guidance on personnel support for ADF and AS members
   during Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS). Personnel support for coalition and
   Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) will be under national responsibility. Where
   it is not defined in this appendix, all other personnel support and
   administration will be IAW Reference A.

**Personnel Management**

2. Contributing Services and parent units are responsible for ensuring personnel
   force assigned (FA) to OSS comply with References B and C, and relevant
   Single-Service instructions/directive prior to Deployment Order or equivalent
   (DEPORD) being issued.
3. **OSD**. An Operational Staffing Document (OSD) will be coordinated at HQHOC.
   Services are allocated positions within an OSD for which they have a staffing
   liability and are to nominate suitable candidates. ADF members will be
   force-assigned to CJTF 667 for the duration of the deployment and cease IAW
   DEPORDs issued.
4. **Personnel Tracking**. All ADF personnel within the CJTF 667 Joint Force
   Area of Operations (JFAO) are to be tracked through the use of the PMKeyS
   Activity Log. Parent units are to ensure all personnel have a PMKeyS Activity
   Log entry for OSS. All movement in and out of the JFAO is to be entered into
   the Activity Log on occurrence.
5. **Performance Appraisal Reporting (PAR).** Reference D outlines the policy in
   relation to performance appraisals in the ADF. Personnel FA to OSS are to
   observe the following reporting requirements:

a. Navy and Army PARs are to be raised for periods of observation of four months
or longer for SECAT 6-7 and SERVOP C personnel. If less than the minimum,
Supplementary Reports are only required for Navy personnel. Parent unit
supervisors are encouraged to seek input from supervisors of the Army members to
include in the PARs.

b. Personnel FA to OSS who observe Air Force subordinates for 20 days or more
should endeavour to consult with the subordinate and their parent unit
supervisor on who is to raise

```
R3-2/3
```

the Personnel Performance Report (PPR). It is likely the case that Air Force
personnel who deploy should request feedback from their OSS supervisors to send
to their parent unit supervisor for incorporation into the PPRs.

6. **Incident Reporting**. All notifiable incidents and serious incidents
   requiring staff action or national/Service notification are to be staffed
   without delay to the HQ CJTF 667 J1. Serious incidents include any matter
   that affects C2 issues, capability, morale or welfare which cannot be
   resolved at component level and/or require national/Service policy guidance.
7. **Discipline**. Investigations of discipline-related notifiable incidents
   will be coordinated by the HQ CJTF 667 J1 (with support from the J06 Legal)
   and conducted by ADFIS investigators. All disciplinary matters will be
   reported and conducted IAW national and Service arrangements.
8. **Unacceptable Behaviour**. Allegations of unacceptable behaviour are to be
   dealt with IAW extant ADF policies, and in addition to normal reporting
   requirements, are to be reported to the HQ CJTF 667 J1. Serious allegations
   or command issues are to be reported to the HQ CJTF 667 JOR. Should an
   allegation remain unresolved on RTA, HQJOC is requested to ensure that the
   complainant’s parent unit is provided with all relevant information to allow
   them to take carriage of the complaint.
9. **Alcohol Consumption**. Consuming alcohol is a legal and socially acceptable
   Australian custom. When controlled and used in moderation, alcohol normally
   presents no problems to individuals, society or the ADF. However, the misuse
   of alcohol can have serious operational, personal, health and safety
   implications. Authority to consume alcohol will be determined by COMD CJTF
   667 IAW local laws and local garrison policies.
10. **Notification of Casualties (NOTICAS)**. NOTICAS reporting must be
    completed IAW Reference E for the following events:

a. a casualty is classified as Very Seriously Injured (VSI), Seriously Injured
(SI) or Satisfactory

b. where a member is to be Medical RTA (MRTA)

c. where a member is declared missing

d. a member is admitted to a health facility.

11. Requests to initiate actions under the Australians Dangerously Ill (AUSDIL)
    Scheme are to be noted in the NOTICAS and undertaken IAW Reference E.
12. **Leave**. Recreation Leave will not be granted for ADF personnel during
    OSS.

```
R3-3/3
```

13. **Unscheduled Return to Australia (RTA)**. An unscheduled RTA is a return
    which is neither planned nor consistent with the member’s DEPORD.
    Unscheduled RTA will generally fall into one of the following categories:

a. **Compulsory Cancellation of Force Assignment (CCFA)**. Members may be
returned from operations for administrative or disciplinary reasons, at the
discretion of COMD CJTF 667 or at the request of a Service Chief.

b. **Service required CCFA**. On occasion the Services may require the
cancellation of a member’s FA for issues relating to the member’s performance,
behaviour or conduct which occurred prior to FA to CJTF 667, but which were
identified after FA occurred. In these circumstances, the Service should
immediately notify HQJOC that they are considering CCFA for the member in
question.

c. **Compassionate RTA**. Reference A describes entitlements to and conditions
applicable for compassionate leave and travel. The approving authority for COPAS
RTA is COMD CJTF 667.

d. **Early RTA (ERTA)**. ERTA may be approved for Service Raise, Train, Sustain
(RTS) purposes at the request of the Service Chief.

e. **Medical RTA (MRTA)**. MRTA is used for members who can no longer be
retained operationally due to medical reasons.

**Morale, Welfare and Recreation**

14. **Provision of amenities**. Recreational and retail amenities will be
    provided at each staging APOD/SPOD. Services such as internet will be
    limited depending on OPSEC and available bandwidth.
15. **Family support**. Support for families of deployed members is available
    through the member’s home unit, the National Welfare Coordination Centre
    (NWCC) and Defence Community Organisation (DCO). Prior to deployment, home
    unit COs are to ensure that all deployed member’s PMKeyS records are up to
    date. Additional support will be provided through the parent Unit Welfare
    Plan.
16. **Voting in Australian Elections**. Members are to ensure that they comply
    with Australian Electoral Commission requirements for voting while overseas.
    Members may enrol as a general postal voter prior to an election being
    called. Postal vote applications will be competed as part of pre-deployment
    admin. Postal staff will be responsible for the distribution and collation
    of postal votes for the CJTF.

MORTUARY AFFAIRS
```

**References:**

A. ADFP 1.1.1 – _Mortuary Affairs_ Edition 2 B. Defence Casualty and Bereavement
Support Manual (DCBSM) C. DEFLOGMAN, Part 2, Vol 8, Chap 7 – _Defence Compliance
with Australian Biosecurity Measures_

**Overview**

1. Support to Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS) will involve the risk of AS
   casualties and death. The purpose of this appendix is to detail the policy
   for the repatriation of all AS CJTF 667 deaths back to Australia.
   Repatriation of deceased remains from TCNs will be under national
   responsibility though CJTF 667 will provide assistance as much as possible.
   References A to C provide specific guidance. Due to the warlike nature of
   OSS, the ability to adhere to these processes in a timely manner may be
   difficult, but all effort must be made to ensure that this process is
   completed.

**Notification and Reporting**

2. The immediate action for notification in the event of a FATALCAS is to occur
   as follows:

a. voice notification to COMD CJTF 667 (or his representative)

b. voice notification to HQJOC JOR

c. FATALCAS message – format detailed in Reference B.

3. Any death is a notifiable incident and will be investigated accordingly.
4. Formal identification of the deceased can only be made by qualified forensic
   specialists; however, for the purposes of notification and to meet reporting
   requirements, tentative identification of the deceased may occur when:

a. the death is witnessed

b. the deceased is wearing identification

c. the deceased is recognised by comrades

d. there is no fragmentation or disfigurement of the remains.

```
R4-2/6
```

**Immediate Actions at the Incident Site**

5. In the event of a fatality, the legal jurisdiction under which the Human
   Remains (HR) will fall will depend on the circumstances of death and
   military, legal and diplomatic authorities. Unless these authorities impose
   contrary arrangements, the remains are to be retained under ADF jurisdiction
   with Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS) taking the lead,
   and are not to be handed over to local authorities.

**Fact Finding**

6. COMD CJTF 667 is to ensure that:

a. An officer not below the rank of CAPT (O3) and not directly linked to the
death completes a Defence Incident Record (DIR) and conducts an immediate Fact
Finding report.

b. The Reporting of Fact Finding process is not to interfere with securing the
scene of death or the subsequent Service Police (SP) investigation.

**Securing the Incident Scene and Collecting Forensic Evidence**

7. The incident site should be protected and preserved in order to facilitate
   any subsequent enquiry or investigation where and when the tactical situation
   allows. The first members on the scene will apply REACT principles IAW
   Reference B and assume control until relieved by an incident commander or SP.
   ADFIS will be responsible for the collection and preservation of all
   essential material connected with the death, which may include the recovery
   of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and weapons.

**Identification of Remains**

8. All ADF personnel are to wear ADF identification tags (stamped with PMKeyS
   number) and are to ensure that they carry their Defence ID card at all times.
   A tentative identification of a body may be conducted based on ADF
   identification tags.
9. Formal identification of remains for return to Next of Kin (NOK) and deceased
   estate management is to only be conducted by qualified forensic specialists.
   Commanders and unit personnel may assist in tentative identification as a
   result of their close association at the time of the incident, or being a
   witness to the incident; or the presence of personal effects on the remains;
   however, this is only to be considered as an unconfirmed identification.
   Preservation of remains, personal effects and Tertiary Identified Material
   will assist in the process of formal identification at a later stage.
   Military identification tags present on the deceased at the time of death
   assists in the tentative identification only and are not to be removed from
   the remains.
10. The formal identification process will usually occur in an Australian
    civilian mortuary, under the auspices of the State Coroner. The complexity
    of the incident and the operational environment may require this
    identification to be conducted in the JFAO to facilitate the repatriation of
    the remains. Remains will not be released to families without positive
    identification conducted by qualified personnel.

```
R4-3/6
```

**Viewing of Remains**

11. Viewing of remains is only to be carried out by those personnel directly
    involved in the case management of, or preparation of the remains for
    identification and repatriation. ADFIS will strictly control access to the
    mortuary facility. The viewing of remains by family or other with a close
    emotional attachment to the deceased is not to occur. Any such requests for
    a viewing are to be referred to COMD CJTF 667.

**Mass Casualties/Disaster Victim Identification (DVI)**

12. In the event of a mass casualty incident or an incident where an ADF death
    has occurred, and scientific identification of remains is required either
    because of fragmentation, burns or mingling with foreign remains, a discrete
    DVI operation id to be formed. In such an incident, COMD CJTF 667 or his
    delegate Component Commander will remain the incident commander where
    tactically feasible.
13. Unqualified personnel should not attempt to associate partial remains with a
    particular deceased member. As with whole remains, formal identification of
    partial remains can only be conducted by qualified personnel. Where a
    casualty or body parts are not able to be immediately identified, they
    should be segregated and individually marked with a label clearly showing
    that they are unidentified. Where the number of casualties is five or
    greater, remains should not be labelled other than with numbers to avoid
    misidentification of remains. ADFIS will be responsible for the management
    and processing of all forensic material, including unidentified remains.

**Mortuary Affairs Officer (MAO) Responsibilities**

14. The MAO for CJTF 667 will be the J1. The MAO is to:

a. determine, in conjunction with the J07, the appropriate levels of AS mortuary
supplies and equipment in location

b. provide advice to COMD CJTF 667 on priority of support for assets in the
recovery and repatriation of AS remains

c. provide support and assistance to ADF investigators and other key
stakeholders on the status of AS deceased personnel

d. monitor the movement of AS remains and regular reporting to HQ CJTF 667

e. coordinate data on the status of deceased and missing personnel.

```
R4-4/6
```

**Repatriation Procedures**

15. Repatriation of AS remains is the responsibility of COMD CJTF 667 IAW
    Reference B. Where applicable, AS remains should be handled under the
    following procedures IAW Reference B. Wherever possible, ADFIS will conduct
    all necessary procedures to ensure evidential continuity from the overseas
    location to handover in AS to the appointed coroner:

a. as soon as the HR is released from the incident scene, the remains should be
placed into a remains pouch and an identification label should be affixed to the
pouch and remains.

b. where an approved label is not immediately available, an interim label should
be used. As a minimum, the label should list name, rank, PMKeyS number, unit,
nationality and religious preference of the deceased (if known as per the
deceased identification tags)

c. if a remain pouch is unavailable as suitable replacement should be used to
cover the remains prior to evacuation

d. ensure the member’s identification tags stay with the remains until
repatriation has been completed to mortuary facilities

e. all personal items in the vicinity should be preserved, however any item not
found on the body should not be shrouded with the body and should be packaged
separately (this includes identification tags if they are not attached to the
body).

16. Where possible, a chaplain of the denomination of the deceased is to be
    notified to provide ritual/rites to the deceased.

**Escort of Remains**

13. COMD CJTF 667 is to ensure that the remains are accompanied from the
    mortuary collection point to the handover to the coroner’s representative in
    Australia by at least two escort officers, one being ADFIS or a SP member to
    maintain chain of custody for evidentiary reasons and an AS member of the
    deceased member’s unit not below the rank of SGT or equivalent. In the case
    of multiple deaths and subsequent repatriation, the Provost Marshall, ADF is
    the determining authority for the number and rank of Service Police escorts.
14. The selection of personnel to act as a unit escort is to comply with the
    guidelines in Reference A with the additional requirement that family
    members are not to act as escorts. Escorts are not required to view the
    remains.
15. Requests for Family representatives to escort. Requests for family
    representatives to accompany HR on a repatriation flight will not be
    approved. While mindful of the reasoning behind such requests, advice should
    be given to the requesting family by either Service HQ or HQJOC
    representatives that approval will not be granted.

```
R4-5/6
```

**Certifying Cause of Death**

16. The examining Medical Officer (MO) may not be able to ascertain the cause of
    death without a post-mortem. In this case, the MO will be required to
    provide written certification that death has occurred and the cause of death
    is to be ascertained by post-mortem at a later stage.
17. An appropriately qualified medical doctor may sign a certificate of death as
    a competent authority. As signed certificate of death is to contain the
    statement that the deceased member was a member of the ADF who died while on
    service, is of the same force and effect as a certificate signed by a duly
    qualified medical practitioner of the State or Territory in which the death
    occurred.

**Post-Mortem**

18. It is in the wider ADF interest to have the option of performing Post-Mortem
    Examination (PME) in order to clarify the exact cause of death and for this
    to be conducted in AS. Where mass casualties of AS members occur, and the
    remains are under ADF control, COMD CJTF 667 will seek immediate guidance
    from HQJOC if they believe that the PME should be carried out in theatre. It
    should be noted that there may be other circumstances other than casualty
    situations where post-mortem is determined not to be necessary, however,
    this will be determined after consultation with the nominated AS Coroner.

**Movement to Australia**

19. COMD CJTF 667 remains responsible for movement of remains as per Reference
    B, and will ensure that HQJOC is notified of arrival times of aircraft into
    AS.
20. HQJOC will notify 1 JMU on receipt of a FATALCAS from COMD CJTF 667 of the
    requirement for repatriation of HR in order to:

a. accommodate Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) requirement
for a minimum 72hrs notice prior to arrival of HR

b. enable effective movement planning and timely issue of WNGO and MOVREQ.

21. Each situation is to be managed individually, with the primary aim of being
    to expedite the deceased member’s return to AS while cognisant of the ADF’s
    requirements to conduct any ADFIS investigation. MAO in concert with ADFIS
    and movement staff are to ensure:

a. remains are to be stored at a constant cool temperature between 1 and 4
degrees Celsius to assist in preservation of the HR

b. if this is not possible, the remains can be embalmed or stored in a freezer
if there is no other option to room temperature storage. Embalming impacts on
the ability to complete PME in AS and should be avoided wherever possible.
Approval to embalm is to be given by the J07 HQ CJTF 667.

c. where the remains are to be repatriated to AS by the ADF using civilian
transport, liaison is to be established with DFAT, through the local mission, to
ensure all appropriate local requirements are met.

```
R4-6/6
```

d. no item, including medical devices are to be removed from the HR unless
deemed necessary for investigative or safety reasons. ADFIS should record and
seek approval if removal of medical devices is deemed essential

e. in circumstances where repatriation is not via Service Air, a representative
of the Australian Mission is to be present at the sealing of the casket. This
will occur once identification has been confirmed by the ADFIS escort through
confirmation of the transfer documentation and identification tags with the
casket and remains pouch.

**Australian National Flag (ANF) and Caskets**

22. COMD CJTF 667 will be responsible for ensuring a casket is provided for the
    repatriation of remains regardless of the source of air movement. COMD CJTF
    667 or the Unit Escort Officer will ensure that an ANF is available to drape
    the casket and that it is correctly draped throughout the journey. Where it
    is not practical to drape the casket during movement to the Point of
    Disembarkation (POD), it must be draped when loading at the Point of
    Embarkation and prior to unload at the POD.

**Repatriation of Personal Effects**

23. Reference A contains further details on the management of personal effects
    (PE) of the deceased. It is the responsibility of COMD CJTF 667 to
    repatriate the personal effects to AS. It is preferred that the personal
    effects accompany the body to AS where possible. All valuables including
    jewellery and cash are to be catalogued and packaged for transport to AS.
    This is conducted in conjunction with the escorts. PE are not to change
    custodian at any time without a detailed check and written receipt of items.

**Actions in Australia on Repatriation**

24. A number of actions are required to be undertaken within AS. These actions
    are as follows:

a. ceremonial reception of the HR at the POD in AS is the responsibility of the
deceased’s parent Service.

b. formal handover of the deceased to the nominated coroner in AS will take
place under the technical guidance of the Service Police.

c. Service HQ is responsible for all required administrative arrangements on
arrival of the HR in AS, including Public Affairs

**COMD CJTF 667 Follow-On Actions**

25. COMD CJTF 667 will conduct follow-on actions required of the MAO as part of
    the FATALCAS management process IAW Reference B.

**Situation**

1. **General.** The Combined Joint Task Force 667 (CJTF 667) will deploy under
   the authority of UNSCR 8873, IOT achieve the military interventions as
   detailed in this OPORD (OP STEEL SENTINEL OPORD 01). The Desired End State
   remains the establishment of a sufficiently secure and stable environment in
   the occupied BX islands and improved capability of BX security forces such
   that state-sponsored hostilities have ceased, territorial borders are secure,
   humanitarian assistance programs operate unhindered and transition to a
   UN-sanctioned and/or HN follow-on security force is complete.
2. CJTF 667 will operate within the established JFAO and will be led by AS. CJTF
   667 consists of a HQ, JFMCC, JFLCC, JFACC (OPCON), SOTG, JFLOGCC, and ESG.
   Troop contributing nations currently include New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Papua
   New Guinea, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Other
   like-minded nations may contribute forces or

```
AA-2/17
```

provide materiel support at a future date. As Lead Nation, Australia will
provide critical force enablers, including up to R3 deployed health support.

3. **Aim.** The aim of this Health Support Order (HSO) is to provide the concept
   of health support to OP STEEL SENTINEL, and the medical requirements for AS
   personnel ISO the Operation.
4. **Area of responsibility.** The Pacific region encompassing the countries of
   North Torbia (NT), South Torbia (RT), Belesia (BX), Gabal (GX) and Olvana
   (OV).
5. **Current situation.** The Region is made up of thousands of islands, the
   climate is generally tropical maritime with a relatively cool season from Dec
   to Feb and a hot humid, rainy season with monsoons common during Summer
   months. Average temperatures generally range between 20-30 degrees Celsius,
   but can drop as low as 12 degrees Celsius in some locations**.**
6. Access to healthcare in the major population centres is generally good
   through a public and private health system, however still below Western
   Standards in most areas. In the past 20 years, some infectious degenerative
   diseases have risen in the Region. Many locals are still living in remote and
   hard to reach areas where it is difficult to deliver the health services they
   need, and the scarcity of doctors, nurses and midwives add to the poor health
   delivery system in these areas.
7. Despite relatively strict lockdown enforcements, the Region was hit hard by
   COVID-19 in early 2020. This further depleted an under resourced healthcare
   system and raised regional tensions, and security and stability concerns
   amidst fears of a resurgence of the virus.
8. **Friendly health capabilities.** CJTF 667 will operate within the
   established JFAO and will be led by AS, providing up to Role 3 deployed HS
   through a combination of ADF and Coalition Land and Maritime capabilities, as
   well as tactical, forward and strategic AME through RW and FWAME
   capabilities. All TCNs will deploy with a minimum of integral R1 HS
   capabilities. Primary Role 3 for AS casualties will be through the NSB
   (Flight time from AO to Darwin <5hrs). Access to the USNS Mercy (Maritime
   Role 3) may be coordinated through the CJTF 667 J07.

a. **USNS Mercy**. USNS Mercy is a Role 3 Hospital Ship that is recognised
internationally as a neutral participant. It provides the following capacity:

```
(1) Intensive care wards: 80 beds
```

```
(2) Recovery wards: 20 beds
```

```
(3) Intermediate care wards: 280 beds
```

```
(4) Light care wards: 120 beds
```

```
(5) Limited care wards: 500 beds
```

```
AA-3/17
```

```
(6) Total Patient Capacity: 1000 beds
```

```
(7) Operating Rooms: 12
```

9. Whilst all TCNs will retain overall responsibility for medical support to
   their troops, AS personnel and capabilities may provide HS to HN and
   Coalition personnel IAW the Medical Rules of Entitlement outlined in
   Enclosure 3.
10. **Civilian Medical Infrastructure.** Medical infrastructure within HN is
    restricted. Except under emergency circumstances, and through approval of
    the CJTF 667 J07 Military forces will not use HN medical facilities.
11. **External agencies**. External agencies are defined as any agency or force
    not under the command and control of the CJTF 667 J07, and they are not to
    be accessed for health care. These include, but are not limited to NGOs,
    Religious Missions and other humanitarian agencies, which may be present in
    the AO.
12. **Assumptions.** All TCN personnel will abide by comparable pre-deployment
    health screening measures and employ required mitigations to minimise the
    impact of exposure to health threats within the Region.
13. **Limitations.** HN medical assets are extremely limited throughout the AO
    with primary focus on the civilian population. Except under emergency
    circumstances, CJTF 667 Military forces will not use HN medical facilities
    and Legal authorization is required before Coalition medical forces provide
    any non-emergency care to foreign nationals
14. In mass casualty situations, the capacity of hospitals, pharmaceuticals for
    advanced treatment, and detection equipment will be overwhelmed.
15. Only decontaminated or non-infectious patients will be transported via
    STRATAME unless the aircraft and receiving facilities are prepared and
    authorized to receive contaminated or infected casualties
16. **Health threat to Friendly Force Elements (FE).** Person-to-person
    communicable diseases, food and water borne diseases, climatic conditions
    and occupational hazards represent the greatest health risks to deployed
    personnel. Use of mitigating practices reduces the health risks in the
    Region to LOW in most circumstances. A health risk assessment matrix for
    this region is at Enclosure 1.

a. **Air quality.** Air quality in this region may be significantly reduced.
Management of ADF Activities and personnel in environments with reduced air
quality is to be IAW Ref A.

b. **Bio-scientific Capabilities and Bio-threats**. Review threat assessments
for the AO regularly, but at this time there is expected to be no biological
threat capabilities.

17. **Casualty estimate. TBC**

```
AA-4/17
```

**Mission**

18. Maintain the physical and psychological well-being of FE deploying on OP
    STEEL SENTINEL.

**Execution**

19. The concept of health support is as follows:

a. **Purpose.** To maintain the physical and psychological health and well-being
of all FE deploying on OP STEEL SETINEL.

b. **Method.** HS arrangements apply to FE deploying to the region in the
following phases:

```
(1) Force preparation. This commences upon notification of deployment.
Individuals deploying on OP STEEL SENTIEL are required to be medically and
dentally fit, individually ready, have an in-date, age-related preventive health
examination and pre-deployment health screening assessment completed, IAW
Ref B. Pre-deployment HS will be provided to individuals through extant Joint
Health Command (JHC) Garrison Health Service arrangements. ADF Civilians
deploying, must also meet pre-deployment medical and dental requirements for
their deployed location. Information pertaining to the pre deployment
requirements for this operation is listed at Enclosure 2 of this document.
```

```
(2) Conduct of operations. This is to be IAW this HSO, and commences upon
arrival in the AO. HS will be provided to CJTF 667 personnel through a
combination of ADF, coalition health assets and potentially a contracted health
support solution. The placement of R2E and Role 3 deployed capabilities will
achieve 10:1:2 healthcare continuum for all population at risk where possible
dependent on terrain and operational conditions. CJTF 667 J07 is to enable
casualty regulation and tracking for the duration of the Operation. HQJOC Air
Operations Command Aeromedical Evacuation Co-ordination Cell (AOC AECC)
will coordinate the MRTA of casualties as required.
```

```
(3) Post-Operational administration. Commences once FE commence RTA
administration. Information pertaining to the post deployment requirements for
OP STEEL SENTINEL is listed at Enclosure 3 of this document. Upon RTA,
health support will revert to extant JHC or relevant National agency
arrangements. Concludes once all medical administration and reports are
finalised.
```

c. **Endstate.** All personnel that deployed on OP STEEL SENTINEL received
appropriate and timely health support, have re-deployed to parent Unit locations
and/or have been transferred to the care of JHC or relevant National agency for
further management.

```
AA-5/17
```

20. **Health Force Preparation Requirements** :

a. **First Aid.** All ADF personnel deploying to the Region should meet Service
specific First Aid proficiency requirements prior to deploying.

b. **Pre-deployment health briefs**. The mounting authority is responsible for
ensuring all personnel receive relevant pre-deployment health briefs prior to
departure.

21. **Deployed Health Support**. Deployed HS for Defence personnel is as
    follows:

in the provision of First Aid to single Service standards.

b. **Role 1 HS**. Will be provided through a combination of ADF and relevant
Coalition health assets.

c. **Role 2/2E HS**. Will be provided through a combination of ADF and coalition
health assets. The ADF will deploy up to two R2E (from 17X and 1EHS RAAF)
scalable dependent on phase and expected dependency _(with option to deploy
Maritime R2E)_.

d. **Role 3 HS.** In most cases, casualties will be strategically evacuated to
health facilities in Australia through the AECC. However, the USNS Mercy will
provide an afloat Role 3 facility to be utilised at the discretion of the
Casualty Regulation (CASREG) Cell.

e. **Contracted Health Solutions.** A contracted health solution may be
requested for HS upon approval by HQJOC. The following services may potentially
be provided by contracted health solution:

```
(1) augmentation of R2E facilities
```

```
(2) coordination of emergency evacuation back to NSB
```

```
(3) to assist in coordination between IOs and NGOs for treatment of civilian
casualties.
```

22 **Holding policy.** Holding policy at R1 will be dictated by the tactical
scenario and availability of RWAME. Holding policy at R2 and above is 5 days.
Patients requiring medical supervision for a period longer than 5 days will be
MRTA. This may be adjusted by the CJTF 667 J07 to manage patient flow as
required.

23. **Casualty Regulation (CASREG).** Theatre CASREG will be overseen by the
    CJTF 667 J07 CASREG Cell.

a. **Tactical regulation.** Tactical casualty regulation is carried out by
health facilities ICW the CJTF 667 J07 CASREG Cell.

AA-6/17
```

b. **Strategic regulation.** Regulation and movement of patients outside the AO
is a HQJOC responsibility. CJTF 667 J07 is responsible for requesting Strategic
Aeromedical Evacuations (STRAT AME). Air Operations Command Aeromedical
Evacuation Co- ordination Cell (AOC AECC) within HQJOC will coordinate and
control all STRAT AME.

24. **Mass Casualties (MASCAS).** All deployed units must be prepared for a
    MASCAS event. This includes a MASCAS plan and conducting rehearsals. In case
    of a catastrophic event that creates a MASCAS situation, the principles of
    triage will be applied. CJTF 667 J07 CASREF Cell will cross-level patient
    load and HSS staffing.
25. **Casualty evacuation (CASEVAC)** Depending upon which location evacuation
    is required, these services will be provided by either ADF, coalition forces
    or civilian assets.

a. **Surface CASEVAC.** Within the AO, only Military evacuation platforms will
be utilised.

b. **Tactical and Forward AME.** Tactical and Forward RWAME will be provided by
ADF/CF assets.

c. **STRATAME.** FW STRATAME will be via the APOD at General Santos
International Airport, with an alternate APOD at Colonel Edwin Andrews Airbase,
Zamboanga, BX.

26. **Medical Return to Australia (MRTA).** The following procedures are to be
    followed for personnel requiring MRTA:

a. All personnel being MRTA due to active medical problems must be managed
through the STRATAME process. There are to be no administrative moves for
personnel who are MRTA.

b. A NOTICAS (IAW Ref C), MEDICAS (IAW Ref D) and STRATAME Requests are to be
raised IOT facilitate the individuals movements back to Australia.

c. All personnel subject to MRTA are to be counselled by their treating MO or
CoC as to the rationale for their return and this is to be documented in their
Defence e-Health System (DeHS) profile.

27. **Dental support**. Emergency dental support will be provided by the R2E or
    USNS Mercy. Any AS person requiring a greater level of dental care than can
    be provided in theatre will be MRTA.
28. **Psychological support.** Psychological support will be provided by ADF
    assets Psych Support Teams (PsST) based at the R2E, but capable of forward
    deploying. Where deemed necessary, AS individuals requiring further
    psychological support will be MRTA for specialist treatment in Australia.

```
AA-7/17
```

29. IAW Ref E, a Critical Incident Mental Health Support (CIMHS) plan will be
    enacted following consultation with HQJOC J07 and 1st Psychology Unit in the
    event that a group or individual response is required.
30. **Environmental Health (EH) Support**. EH support will be provided by the
    R2E.

1. **Situation**.

a. North Torbia (NT).

```
(1) Space Capabilities. While possessing a growing indigenous space capability, NT’s
threat space capabilities will continue to be augmented to a more robust standard by
those state/non-state actors willing to provide or disseminate technology to NT.
(a) Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA).
RISTA is viewed as the single-most important function for the NT military. Thus,
NT forces typically commit significant resources to RISTA-related operations,
which are usually aggressive with overlapping redundancy in the intelligence
disciplines. NT has access to a government owned and operated low resolution
imaging satellite. To further supplement its Image Intelligence (IMINT)
requirements, the NT military regularly purchases commercial imagery from other
countries. This more robust use of space-based ISR will be dependent upon the
nations or non-state actors friendly to NT willing to provide access to satellite
imagery possessing more adequate persistence of re-visit time. More likely
however, NT will supplement its indigenous capability by accessing commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) vendors or technologies. The risk to operations escalates
with quality of the collectors and the persistence of coverage of the Joint Force
Area of Operations (JFAO).
(b) Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT). NT’s military is believed to use
commercial L-band receivers that are reciprocal with Global Positioning System
(GPS), the Donovian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), or the
Olvanan BeiDou Navigation Satellite (BDS) system for navigation. This
highlights the significance of multi-use technologies, utilising technologies
designed for the commercial sector yet adaptable to support military objectives.
Actual use of space-based PNT in employment is directly related to the
technological sophistication of NT’s forces. At this time, it is not expected that
NT will place an undue emphasis/reliance on space-based Position and Navigation
```

```
AB-2/5
for use in navigation and timing. That said, NT will continue to leverage GPS,
GLONASS, or BDS. It is likely that GPS also provides the backbone for timing
for services such as SATCOM.
(c) SATCOM. NT is in the early stages of manufacturing their own satellites.
Presently, NT operates one earth observation satellite that utilizes X-Band
transponders to communicate images for download while in a sun-synchronous
polar orbit. This satellite is projected to be operational for at least four to eight
years, and is claimed to be used for agriculture, mapping, utilities management,
and urban planning. NT may also be using satellites from Olvana, Donovia and
other nations to advance its weapons research programs.
(2) Counter-Space Capabilities. Counter Space capabilities are a set of capabilities that NT
may use to deny Coalition space effects:
(a) ISR. NT knows its ability to negate threats from the US, Coalition, and other
more sophisticated opponents is extremely limited, even given their current
launch/surface-to-surface capabilities. NT may attack sensors, links or ground
stations as a tactical last resort or where enemy sensors appear poorly defended or
unguarded within the JFAO. Any such NT attack would require extensive denial
and deception techniques to close the distance from launch point to target. The
ability to counter Coalition use of space-based ISR is wholly dependent on NT’s
ability to maintain space situational awareness (SSA). As it is unlikely that NT
has the capability for or access to sophisticated SSA, the threat from NT for ISR
counter-space will be minimal.
(b) PNT. The ability to counter Coalition use of space-based PNT will be dependent
on NT’s access to COTS technology or jammers acquired from Olvana, other
vendor nations or third parties.
(c) SATCOM. The ability to counter Coalition use of space-based SATCOM is
determinant on technological sophistication of NT. NT will likely access available
COTS technologies in an attempt to block or deny access to SATCOM. However,
in order for wide denial of access to be successful, it would require access to
infrastructure and international links not currently, or likely to be at their disposal.
Additionally, NT will be careful in that utilising broadband jamming and
SATCOM denial does not antagonise South Torbia into joining the conflict.
(3) Launch Capability. The North Torbian Space Agency, the government organisation with
primary responsibility for space operations, has a very limited capacity to conduct
launches with very limited payloads.
```

b. Coalition Forces.

```
(1) General. Australia is a signatory to five legally binding space specific treaties (Refs A –
E) which dictates how the space domain is utilised. For most nations, the civilian and
commercial segments dominate space operations. Therefore, civilian space agencies
have often taken the leadership role for space. Generally, these civilian space agencies
will not involve themselves in active conflict zones. However, there may be agreements
and procedures in place for them to support military operations.
```

```
AB-3/5
(2) Space Capabilities. Coalition forces use a wide range of space-based ISR assets,
typically from allied nations under extant arrangements, through to the use of COTS
vendors or technologies. Use of space based PNT and SATCOM by the Coalition is
ubiquitous at all levels; denial of this capability would be debilitating.
(3) Counter-Space Capabilities. Coalition forces will have access to counter-PNT,
SATCOM, and ISR capabilities but not within the outer space domain. The Coalition
can leverage existing legislation from respective governments to interrupt or restrict
service by commercial satellite imagery providers over the JFAO.
(4) Host Nation (HN).
(a) Belesia (BX). As a less technologically developed country, BX relies on third
party satellite services, leasing commercial Ku-band transponders from larger,
more developed countries. This capability may also be used to support
government and military operations. BX commercially purchases global
positioning receivers that support commercial needs as well as military navigation
and targeting operations.
```

c. Olvana (OV).

```
(1) Satellite Telecommunications. Olvana is the largest, most dominant country in the
region, possessing a wide range of satellite capabilities. Most are suited for dual-use by
the Olvanan military. Currently, Olvana operates seven commercial telecommunications
satellites utilising Ku-band transponders in a geostationary orbit. All satellites are
powered by solar array panels. These commercial satellites may be used to support
military operations when necessary. Additionally, the Olvanan People’s Army (OPA)
operates four communication satellites using Ku and C band transponders. The satellites
are in a geostationary orbit powered by solar array antenna. The OV government also
leases bandwidth from commercial satellite companies that support government and
military operations when necessary.
(2) Navigation. OV has an established history in the development and use of navigation
satellite systems. Currently, OV operates 16 navigation satellite systems using E-band
transponders (BDS). The combined systems create a network of navigation services and
provide regional coverage of the Asia-Pacific region. The services are free to civilian
and licensed to the OV government and military.
(3) Implications. The widespread and robust OV space assets and capabilities will
complicate, and in some cases hinder, CJTF 667 space/counter-space operations. In
particular the possibility that NT could utilize OV space assets to mitigate Coalition
counter-space operations cannot be discounted.
```

2. **Mission**. COMD CJTF 667 coordinates the employment and defence of
   identified allied space services supporting the stated overall mission and,
   on order, deny the enemy freedom of action derived via space capabilities.

```
AB-4/5
```

3. **Execution.**

a. General. The use of space capabilities is a significant force multiplier when
properly integrated within CJTF 667 operations. The success of CJTF 667
operations partially depends on using space capabilities to monitor Maritime,
Land and Air operations and must be protected, coordinated and synchronised in
an efficient manner. In order to achieve optimal space support, space
capabilities whose effects emanate from and through space from military,
national, civil, commercial, and multinational providers will be integrated into
the planning and execution cycle of the CJTF 667 campaign.

b. Intent. COMD CJTF 667 will take advantage of the Coalition’s asymmetric
advantage in space by fully integrating and synchronizing operations within the
atmosphere with space- based capabilities made available for mission execution.
As such, it is intended to establish a Space Coordination Authority (SCA)
function within the JFACC (AOSC) that will provide the necessary coordination of
space operations with subordinate commands at the HQJOC level. The role of SCA
function within the JFACC is to primarily coordinate space employment, defense
planning and coordination via the Components of the headquarters staff with
assistance and input from the maritime, land, air, and special operations
components. COMD CJTF 667 will defend space capabilities within the atmosphere
above and the geographic territory within the JFAO to the maximum legal extent
possible. When deemed necessary to create conditions for success, COMD CJTF 667
will deny the enemy freedom of action derived from space capabilities within the
boundaries established by the rules of engagement.

c. Concept of Operations. Component Commanders will establish Space Support
Elements (SSEs) staffed by qualified Space Operations Officer(s) (SOOs).
SSEs/SOOs will form part of the SCA Working Group (SCAWG) to plan, coordinate,
and synchronize and resource space operations.

d. Tasks.

```
(1) SCA. The SCA will be established as a staff function within the JFACC. Tasks:
(a) Chair the SCA Working Group (SCAWG).
(b) Integrate space capabilities.
(c) Plan, coordinate, and synchronize space operations in the JFAO and ensuring
inputs from Components are incorporated.
(d) Maintain situational awareness of theater space operations, and coordinating with
the Component Commands to integrate theater space operations.
(e) Provide consolidated space requirements through COMD CJTF 667 for
coordination as required.
(f) Produce a Joint Prioritized Space Effect List (JPSEL) to be included into the
normal decision cycle/battle rhythm of the HQ. The JPSEL will be included for
recommendation at the Joint Coordination Working Group, and for decision at the
Joint Coordination Board.
(g) Produce the Joint Space Situational Awareness Picture (JSSAP), as relevant to the
JOA.
```

```
AB-5/5
(2) SSE:
(a) Provide tactical and operational space planning and support to subordinate
headquarters.
(b) Advise on space force enhancement and space control mission areas.
(c) Advise on availability and use of military/civil/commercial space-based assets.
(d) Advise regarding the capabilities, limitations, and status of missile warning
systems.
(e) Produce space support annex and space input to planning and orders.
(f) Participate in initial targeting process.
(g) Advise regarding space support to Information Operations (IO).
(h) Provide space support products and services.
(i) Synchronize space operations and effects.
(j) Recommend/coordinate for additional space support and force structure.
(k) Coordinate with higher headquarters space element.
(l) SOO. The SOO is responsible for providing space-related operational support and
expertise on space capabilities to Component Commanders. The SOO integrates
space force enhancement and space control operations, and supports both
deliberate and crisis action planning. The SOO is charged to:
```

1. Provide space-based expertise and services.
2. Maintain space situational awareness.
3. Identify prioritized enduring and emerging space requirements to the HQ CJTF
   667 via the SCAWG.
4. Report any interference or other unplanned outages to military mission
   enabling space services to the HQ CJTF 667 JOC or HQ CJTF 667 J35 Space SME
   as soon as possible.
5. Identify possible target sets that enable space services/effects to the
   enemy.
6. **Sustainment.** No change.
7. **Command and Signal.**

a. Space Support Requests (SSRs) should be passed to the HQ CJTF 667.

b. Space capabilities are provided via a Community of Shared Interest. COMD CJTF
667 does not directly control space assets, but will coordinate space effects
from participating space providers for planning and execution.

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of CJTF 667 OPORD 01 (Ref A) and
Annex B - Intelligence.

b. General. Engineer operations for CJTF 667 require a rapid build-up of
Mobility (M)/Counter mobility (CM)/Survivability (S)/General Engineer (GE)
capacity across the Combined, Joint, Interagency domain.

c. Purpose. The purpose of this Annex is to describe the Scheme of Engineer
Operations and provide Engineer guidance at the operational level.

d. Engineer Intelligence. Refer to Annex B to CJTF 667 OPORD 01.

e. Operational Areas.

```
(1) Joint Force Area of Operations (JFAO). The JFAO includes the landmasses, national air
space and territorial waters of Belesia (BX), the Sulu Sea, parts of the Celebes Sea, the
Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The landmass, airspace and territorial waters of
Gabal (GX) and South Torbia (RT) remain neutral and are excluded from the JFAO.
(2) JFLCC Area of Operations (AO). The JFLCC AO is comprised of the landmass,
airspace and territorial waters (12NM) of BX.
```

f. Terrain and Man-Made Features. See the BX Country Study (Ref B).

g. Civil Considerations

```
(1) As an island nation, BX relies on a network of regular maritime ferry and domestic air
services to move personnel and freight amongst its various islands. Typically, the
maritime ferry services are the primary means of inter-island transportation. BX roads
networks on the larger islands are mainly paved. However, there are numerous
unimproved dirt and gravel roads throughout the area, especially on the smaller islands,
or islands with a small population. Disrupting mobility would be easily affected by
damaging paved roads through the use of IEDs or cratering charges. Rural roads do not
receive proper maintenance, leaving them susceptible to damage from the weather and
neglect. The monsoonal season also has a drastic effect on the inland roads with
communities at time being cut off and isolated during severe weather. BX is currently
constructing a railway network in Mindanao, connecting all the major cities, but will not
see operational service for at least another 5 years. There is a nascent railway
connecting the cities of Iloilo and Roxas on Panay, but has not seen operations since
1985.
```

```
AC-2/7
(2) Citizens of BX hold their religion in high esteem and many religious centers and
structures are considered to be very important. These structures should be avoided for
targeting or used to tie-in obstacles in urban terrain.
(3) Most of the region, particularly rural areas, cannot access all modern utilities such as
potable water, electricity, and modern sewage systems. This will cause a reliance on
military electrical, water and sanitation systems.
(4) Paramilitary, insurgent, and guerilla forces operate in BX. This could lead to an
increased use of IEDs in Panay, particularly on main highways and field landing strips,
having a negative impact on mobility.
(5) BX contains a number of heavily populated areas such as the cities on Panay. Enemy
operations in these areas could result in the Host Nation asking for engineers to provide
survivability/force protection, and general engineering assistance.
```

h. Enemy Engineer Forces. See Annex B Intelligence and NT Country Study (Ref C).

i. Friendly Engineer Forces. See Belesian Country Study (Ref B).

2. **Mission.** CJTF 667 conducts military operations to expel all NT forces
   from Belesian sovereign territory in order to create conditions for the
   re-establishment of a safe and secure environment in Belesia and the
   surrounding region.
3. **Execution.**

a. Concept of Engineer Support. The Coalition engineer effort will be centrally
planned and coordinated, and executed by the Component organic and assigned
engineers. Theatre planning and coordination for engineer support will be
provided by the Joint Force Engineer, supplemented by elements from 19 Chief
Engineering Works. Theater-level engineering support will be provided by 6th
Engineer Support Regiment (6 ESR) as part of the JFLCC. Capabilities of the Host
Nation civil authorities must be effectively leveraged in order to quickly
establish the Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD) and Air Port of Disembarkation
(APOD) at General Santos City and Zamboanga to facilitate preparations for
reception, staging, onward movement and integration (RSO&I) activities. Each
Combat Bde within the JFLCC will have organic engineer support to provide
intimate mobility/counter- mobility/survivability support. RAAF Airfield
Engineers (65 Sqn) will provide intimate support to the APODs through the Combat
Support Squadrons assigned to each APOD. HN engineering capability will be
required during Ph 4 Transition operations to rebuild infrastructure damaged or
destroyed during the conflict. This may include civilian contractors. The Joint
Force Engineer will be responsible for coordinating all sustainability
engineering support across the JFAO.

b. Scheme of Engineer Operations. CJTF 667 Engineers will provide and
synchronise mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, sustainability and
general Engineer efforts to defeat NT forces and support BX civil authorities.
The majority of planning effort will focus around Phases 3 and 4.

activities to address explosive hazards. Combat engineer unit activities include the
detection, reporting, breaching and clearing of minefields, and the detection, reporting,
and destruction of IEDs. Only EOD units and properly qualified EOD personnel shall
conduct EOD procedures against explosive ordnance, UXO, or IEDs. Attempts will be
made to render safe explosive devices for intelligence gathering efforts if the situation
does not affect the local population and CJTF 667 ability to accomplish the mission
being undertaken.
(3) IEDs/Booby-Traps. CJTF 667 will not employ booby-traps or IEDs.
(4) Mines. COMD CFLCC is emplacement authority for AT mines in the CFLCC AO.
Artillery delivered mines and sea mines will not be utilised by CJTF 667. Anti-tank
mines will be surface laid. No AP mines will be utilised.
(5) Humanitarian Demining (HDM). Because of the threat to peace and safety, HDM has
become a significant disarmament and peace operations activity. Demining is ultimately
an HN responsibility; however, CJTF 667 may assist BX through mine awareness
education and training of HN personnel in the surveying, marking, and clearing of
mines.
```

i. Geospatial. Components and formations will deploy with integral terrain
analysis capabilities. heater geospatial support will be provided by 5 Coy, 1
Int Bn.

j. Firefighting. CFACC and CFMCC will deploy with organic firefighting
capabilities, as will the National Support Elements from TCNs. Fire protection
will be coordinated with the Host Nations. The CER will provide close
firefighting capabilities ISO RW operations. 6 ESR will be responsible for CJTF
667 policy on firefighting capabilities for CJTF 667 facilities. TCNs will
develop fire prevention and protection plans for TCN-owned or rented facilities
that meet CJTF-667 standards. CJTF-OIG fire protection priorities are: (1) APODs
and SPODs. (2) Medical facilities. (3) Ammunition and fuel storage
installations.

```
AC-6/7
(4) CJTF 667 and Component Headquarters and communication centers.
(5) CFACC airfields.
(6) Personnel accommodation facilities.
```

k. Reach back. The Joint Force Engineer will facilitate the utilization of NSB
engineer capabilities. All requests for assistance will be passed to the Joint
Force Engineer.

l. Facilities.

```
(1) Facility planning factors include: CJTF 667 concept of operations; expected duration
and intensity of operations; cost of facility; time-phased activities; and prioritizing the
use of existing assets over new construction.
(2) The six broad categories of facilities in order of priority for use are: TCN-owned,
occupied, or leased facilities; Host Nation, allied, and Coalition support where an
agreement exists to provide specific types and quantities of facilities at specified times
in designated locations; TCN-owned facility substitutes pre-positioned in theater;
facilities available from commercial sources; TCN-owned facility substitutes stored in
contributing nations; and construction of facilities that are considered shortfall after an
assessment of the availability of existing assets.
(3) Contracting support should be used to augment military capabilities. Because
construction is time consuming and entails the risk of not being finished in time to meet
mission requirements, supported commanders should seek alternative solutions to new
construction.
```

m. Host Nation Support. CJTF 667 Engineers will maximise the use of Host Nation
engineer support. Host-Nation Support planning considerations include the
following: indigenous labor; local availability of construction materiel,
supplies, and equipment; local contractor support; and local facilities.

n. Construction Standards.

```
(1) When new construction is the only means of sourcing facility requirements, it will be
constructed either using respective TCN standards or using temporary guidelines (less
than six months) found in extant Doctrine and Policy. Any exemptions for more
permanent construction standards must be approved by the CJTF 667 Engineer.
(2) Expedient construction (e.g., rapid construction techniques such as pre-fabricated
buildings, clamshell structures, etc.) should also be considered as these methods can be
selectively employed with minimum time, cost, and risk to offer in-theater forces
another source of required temporary facilities.
```

4. **Sustainment.**

a. Logistics. Engineer Units will deploy with their own organic logistic
support, and will receive additional support from their supported Components and
formations.

b. Medical. Engineer Units will deploy with their own organic medical assets
(RAP), and will receive additional support from their supported Components and
formations (R1 – R3).

c. Construction Materiel. Construction materiel is readily available for local
purchase, and contracted construction capability is available.

```
AC-7/7

PRISONER OF WAR AND CAPTURED PERSONNEL HANDLING PROCEDURES
```

1. **Introduction**. This document provides direction and clarification
   regarding the procedures to be used when detaining captured personnel (CPERS
   in accordance with the Geneva Conventions (GC) and Additional Protocol I
   (API) within the CJTF 667 Joint Force Area of Operations (JFAO).
   Consideration must be given at all times as to the status of the CPERS, the
   gathering of evidence at the point of apprehension (PoA) in support of any
   allegation to facilitate the collection of intelligence or subsequent
   prosecution under Coalition or Host Nation (HN) judicial systems, where
   relevant.
2. **General**. Individuals may be detained as a force protection measure to
   prevent them from conducting acts against Coalition forces, Host Nation
   Security Forces (HNSF) or the HN civilian population. Once the threat has
   been removed or neutralised, the on-site commander must determine if the
   CPERS should be released, transferred to a national temporary holding
   facility, or, if they are lawful combatants of belligerent forces, detained
   as enemy prisoners of war (PW) and transferred to a PW holding area or
   detention facility. The detention process to be followed is dependent on the
   category in which the CPERS fall, as follows:

a. Unprivileged Combatant (also referred to as unlawful combatant). A member of
a terrorist group who has committed or has the intent to commit a hostile act
against Coalition forces, HNSF, HN government personnel or civilians.
Unprivileged combatants are essentially criminals whose acts exceed normal
private criminal activity.

b. Criminals. Pirates, members of a criminal gang, etc. CPERS in this category
should be treated in the same manner as unprivileged combatants.

c. Personnel temporarily detained for Force Protection Measures. These are
persons detained or temporarily held by Coalition forces that, for no apparent
reason and no necessarily intentionally, interfere with operations and pose no
threat to the Coalition forces. Such persons may be detained or held on site and
released immediately if it is determined by the on-site commander that they no
longer pose a threat to the mission or the force. Examples of such persons can
be farmers non-violently defending their fields or property, civilians in the
way of Coalition forces, etc. Proper judgement must be used to not evacuate such
persons if they are not deemed to be a continued threat to the Coalition.

d. PW. PW are defined under Art. 4 of the GC III. GC III will apply as a matter
of law when, and if, the security situation escalates to an international armed
conflict. These include combatants, persons accompanying the armed forces
(civilian contractors, maintenance crews), members of crew of merchant marine or
aircraft, war correspondents and medical personnel accompanying the force.
Combatants include members of an armed force or militias and members of other
volunteer forces providing they meet the following four criteria:

```
(1) Carry arms openly.
(2) Having a fixed and distinctive emblem recognisable at a distance.
(3) Subject to responsible command of NT.
```

```
R-2/7
(4) Abide by the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC).
```

e. Determination of Status. Where GC III and API apply as a matter of law,
persons detained by Coalition forces are presumed to be entitled to PW status,
until the status is determined. Should any doubt about a person’s status remain,
the person’s status shall be determined by a properly constituted status
tribunal. The specific conduct and composition of status tribunals will be
defined in the national law of each contributing nation. Questions concerning PW
status determination under GC III should be directed to the CJTF 667 Legal
Advisor and national legal advisors, as appropriate.

f. Criminal prosecution. If the CPERS are not lawful combatants and have
committed, or attempted to commit, an attack against Coalition, HNSF or another
authority of the government of the HN, evidence relating to the actions and
conduct will be required in support of any subsequent criminal prosecution. If
there are no grounds for further detention, the individual must be released.

g. Common Capture Report (COMCAPREP). A COMCAPREP must be compiled and submitted
through the chain of command for all persons who have been detailed (whether
entitled to PW status or not).

h. Detention operations lead. Wherever possible, HNSF should lead on detention
operations. Coalition forces may carry out detention operations where it is
impossible for the HNSF to do so, or in the event that abuse of the CPERS by
HNSF is feared or suspected, or where it is agreed that Coalition forces should
take the lead (e.g. intelligence-led operations).

i. Persons under the age of 18. Children under the age of 18 (or persons
suspected to be under the age of 18) should not be detained unless categorically
necessary to prevent imminent danger to Coalition forces. Wherever possible, if
children are detained they should be kept within the family groups or should
otherwise not be accommodated with adult detainees.

j. Protection of female detainees. Female detainees must be accommodated
separately to male detainees, except in circumstances where a family group is
detained. Detained family groups, are to be kept separately from other detainees
wherever possible. Further guidance is provided in Annex AE Gender Advisor
Requirements.

k. Timeline. In general, no more than 96 hrs should pass between the CPERS point
of apprehension (PoA) and their subsequent arrival at a national temporary
holding facility. This timeline exists in order to allow for difficult tactical
situations where immediate transfer is not possible.

3. **Application of National Policy**. Coalition forces remain subject to their
   individual national law, policies, and directives. Where such laws, policies,
   or directives diverge from CJTF 667 policies or directives, the more
   restrictive will apply. Divergent policies should be identified through the
   Troop Contributing Nation’s (TCN’s) Provost Marshal (PM) to the CJTF 667 PM
   to be de-conflicted. National policy shall always be followed in the first
   instance with respect to detention; however, the recovery of evidence
   requirements should be adopted as ‘best-practice.’

```
R-3/7
```

4. **Guidance**.

a. Decision to Detain. The decision to detain a person or persons is based on
actions or evidence at the scene. Detention must be reported to CJTF 667 HQ as
soon as practicable using the format at Appendix 1. Criminal activities of a
localized nature (e.g. petty theft) that are not serious crimes do not warrant
detention by Coalition forces. Local law enforcement remains the responsibility
of the HNSF, if purely criminal activity is observed. Nevertheless, Coalition
ROE permits intervention and the use of force by Coalition forces where a
serious crime (such as armed robbery, sexual assault, assault) is observed by
Coalition elements. Where Coalition forces intervene in such circumstances,
every effort shall be made to report to and involve the HNSF at the earliest
possible opportunity as well as the appropriate reporting through the chain of
command. CJTF 667 force elements can detain for one or any combination of the
following reasons:

```
(1) Force protection.
(2) Mission accomplishment.
(3) Observance of a serious crime.
(4) Self-defence.
```

b. Detention Process. National responsibility applies.

c. Use of Military or Service Police (MP). MP should be made available for
advice regarding detention and should be consulted prior to any situation where
detention is a likely outcome. However, detention remains a unit and a chain of
command responsibility. In general, and as a best practice, MP should not accept
custody or responsibility for CPERS until they are delivered to a formation
collection point by the detaining unit/soldier. MP provides Commanders with a
transparent investigative and governance capability that can be tasked to ensure
that CPERS are handled in accordance with national and Coalition policy. When MP
are directly supporting detention, they should be used for:

```
(1) Search of personnel, property, and any scene, with the assistance of the detaining unit.
(2) Advice on what items are of evidential value and then the physical recovery and
exhibiting of all items of evidential value, with the assistance of the detaining unit and
other specialist requirements (ATO/EOD/C-IED) as required.
(3) Assistance with the recording of detaining soldier and detaining call sign statements of
evidence.
(4) Training of Force Element personnel in search, detention, and evidence handling
procedures.
(5) Advice on all detention matters.
(6) Oversight of Task Force-level facilities, when tasked and within means and capabilities.
```

5. **Searches**. The search of a dwelling is the responsibility of the on-site
   commander, based upon a reasonable interpretation of the information
   available at that time and should be cleared through the respective HQs. When
   MP are available, they should take the lead on searching, with the detaining
   Force Elements in support.

```
R-4/7
```

6. **Evidence Requirements**. For those persons not classified as PW, effective
   collection, transfer and storage of detainee-related evidence is essential to
   effective prosecution of criminal acts and helps strengthen the rule of law:

a. Statements. These are additional to the statement on the Capture Card, which
only provides a summary of events. In the absence of MP, statements can be
recorded by the onsite commander but must include statements of all personnel
involved in the capture. There is no format for this statement, but at a minimum
shall contain the following statements:

```
(1) Apprehending soldier,
(2) Qualified Tactical questioner,
(3) Interpreter (witness and ICOM chatter).
(4) Any local national information who observed the event (if possible and through
interpreter).
(5) Statements from all Coalition unit witnesses.
```

b. Photographs. (ideally in electronic format)

```
(1) CPERS with apprehending soldier and a visible name/number board in photo.
(2) The Point of Apprehension (PoA), identifying the grid reference and name of location.
(3) The CPERS at the PoA with all physical evidence recovered, clearly visible in any
photographs. This should include any forensic evidence if possible and where the
tactical situation permits.
(4) Weapons, drugs, large amounts of money or any other items which may indicate
criminal activity.
(5) Vehicles (if applicable) with registration number (license plate) clearly visible.
```

c. Property of evidentiary value. This can include, but is not limited to:

```
(1) Mobile phones should be retained in the exact state in which it was found. It should not
be switched off, nor should anyone call the last number or answer any incoming calls.
(2) CPERS notebooks, maps, notes or other documents found on the individual.
(3) Photocopies of patrol notebooks and notes pertaining to the situation which led to the
capture of the individual.
(4) Small arms (must be cleared and made-safe).
(5) Suspected IED components (wires, cables, batteries, spider boxes, etc.).
(6) Forensic evidence (EXPRAY swab).
(7) Any other item that the detaining call sign may deem necessary.
```

```
R-5/7
```

d. Chain of Custody. As a best practice, the detaining soldier should escort the
CPERS to the appropriate collection point. If this is not possible, then the
statements from all those involved should accompany the CPERS, escort, and all
evidence. If this procedure is not followed, it will likely result in the
detainee being released due to insufficient evidence for continued detention or
transfer. Is important to maintain chain of custody for both the CPERS and the
evidence gathered on the CPERS.

7. **Use of Force**. The ROE at Annex L to the OPORD identifies the appropriate
   levels of force to be used when handling CPERS. It is essential that
   Coalition Force Elements understand that the Use of Force for controlling
   CPERS is dependent on the category in which the individual falls. Lethal
   force can be used to detain and prevent escape of PW, but not criminals and
   unlawful combatants. The minimum amount of force necessary must be applied to
   detain an individual and when dealing with any CPERS. For detained criminals
   and unlawful combatants, lethal force can only be used to remove an imminent
   threat to human life (self defence). For all CPERS, once under control, no
   further force shall be used, unless absolutely necessary to prevent escape,
   injury or in self defence.
8. **Restraint**. Flex cuffs are the primary approved method of restraining
   detainees and, whenever possible, hands shall be cuffed in the front of the
   body and shall be regularly checked in order to ensure that they are not
   harming the CPERS. Hooding is strictly forbidden. In circumstances where it
   is necessary to protect sensitive information or for force protection
   measures, blacked-out goggles may be applied. As soon as the reason for
   restricting CPERS’ vision has passed, the goggles must be removed. _In
   extremis_ , a blindfold may be used, provided it does not cover the mouth or
   nose or otherwise restrict the CPERS’ ability to breathe. Sound attenuation
   devices may also be used if the tactical situation permits.
9. **Reports and Returns**. Timely provision of accurate reports and returns is
   critical to the onward movement and subsequent detention of CPERS. Coalition
   Force Elements are to report the detention of CPERS at the earliest
   opportunity using the following tools:

a. Common Capture Report (COMCAPREP). Appendix 1. Immediately upon detention a
COMCAPREP shall be submitted to CJTF 667 Ops.

```
(1) Designator of capturing unit.
(2) DTG of capture (DDTTTTZMMYY).
(3) Location of capture (UTM grid reference).
(4) Numbers of PWs/detainees captured. (O/N/S/C)(M/F)(NNNN).
(5) Captured enemy documents (CDOC).
(6) Captured enemy equipment (CE).
(7) Circumstances of the capture.
(8) Other points of intelligence interest.
(9) Location of capturing unit at time of COMCAPREP (UTM grid reference).
(10) Evacuation intentions.
```

```
R-6/7
```

b. The COMCAPREP should be filled out and securely attached to the CPERS. It
must record all changes of custody and stay with the CPERS up to the Collection
Point where other tracking methods can be established, or up to a point where
the holding nation can securely control the identity of the CPERS in their
custody.

c. CPERS Internment Serial Number (ISN). Upon receipt of the CPERS ISN, CJTF PM
will issue an Internment Serial Number (as per Appendix 2) to capturing units.
These numbers are to be added to the COMCAPREP and must be reported to the
higher HQ PM on a daily basis if updated.

10. **Injured CPERS**. Where necessary, medical treatment is to be given to the
    same standard as that given to injured Coalition soldiers. Priority of
    treatment is to be assessed on medical grounds alone. If injured detainees
    are to remain in custody after immediate medical treatment, evidence
    justifying their continued detention must be provided.
11. **Humane Treatment, Abuse, and Prohibited Acts**. CPERS must not be subject
    to intimidation, humiliation, or acts of violence. Inhuman or degrading
    treatment including torture is strictly forbidden, illegal, and must be
    investigated. It is the detaining Force Element’s responsibility, and that
    of the on-site commander, to ensure that CPERS are properly treated. This
    responsibility includes preventing, stopping, and reporting incidents of
    abuse by either Coalition forces or HNSF and does not end until the CPERS is
    released. Allegations or suspicions of abuse must be reported to the CJTF
    667 PM, via national PMs. Food and drink shall be given at regular intervals
    and, whenever possible, CPERS will be provided with protection from adverse
    conditions and the elements. Where necessary, medical treatment is to be
    given to the same standard as that given to injured or sick Coalition
    soldiers. Priority of treatment is to be assessed on medical grounds alone.
12. **Tactical Questioning (TQ)**. TQ of CPERS can only be carried out by
    qualified, current personnel in accordance with national training and
    policy. The following types of conditioning are expressly prohibited:

a. Hooding.

b. Physical punishment.

c. Stress positions.

d. Intentional sleep deprivation.

e. Withdrawal of food, water, or medical treatment.

f. Degrading treatment, sexual embarrassment/assault, or religious taunting.

g. The use of white noise.

13. **Authority on Detainees**. CPERS (other than those with a PW status)
    captured by Coalition forces must understand that the authority on captured
    detainees remains with the state and not with the capturing nation. As an
    example, a criminal captured by Coalition forces in Belesia will remain
    under the law enforcement authority of Belesia and must be transferred as
    soon as practicable to a recognized Belesian authority. It is therefore
    important to not remove the CPERS from the state in which captured as this
    could create a political situation where the CPERS could claim refugee
    status in the new state.

```
R-7/7
```

14. **Evacuation to a Different Country**. There may arise emergency
    circumstances where CPERS need to be evacuated directly from one country to
    another, for example from Belesia to Australia, such as where Role 3 or
    higher medical care is required for the injured CPERS. In any circumstance
    where evacuation of CPERS to a different country may be required, COMD CJTF
    667 shall be advised in order to coordinate this requirement with applicable
    national authorities.
15. **Release**. CPERS should be released at the PoA only if the reason for the
    original detention is no longer valid and the threat posed against Coalition
    forces is unlikely to continue. A record of release must be maintained in
    the patrol notebook and details passed to the appropriate higher HQ. Under
    no circumstance should CPERS be transferred directly to HNSF without first
    passing through the National temporary holding facility.
16. **HNSF/Coalition Joint Operations**. If Coalition forces are on a joint
    operation with HNSF, the HNSF shall normally handle any CPERS. If the
    commander of the Coalition element believes that the CPERS will be
    mistreated, or that HNSF are unable to safely and correctly facilitate the
    detention process, the CPERS is to be processed by Coalition forces in
    accordance with the procedures outlined in this document.
17. **Points of Contact**.

a. CJTF 667 Provost Marshal.

b. CJTF 667 Legal Advisor.

COMMON CAPTURE REPORT
```

1. **COMCAPREP**. The COMCAPREP is a standard NATO message which nations have
   agreed to its use through their ratification of AJP 2.5. CJTF 667 uses this
   standard NATO message for all PW/Detainee reporting.
2. **Purpose of the Report**. The purpose of the report is to:

a. Alert the J2/G2/N2 organisations of the possible capture of a potential
source of information.

b. Alert the PW Holding Organisation (PWHO) to the capture of PW/Detainees so
that arrangements for the movement care and disposal of the PW/Detainee can be
put in effect.

3. **Completion of the Report**. Capturing units are to complete the COMCAPREP
   as fully as the circumstances allow but the evacuation of PW/Detainees should
   not be delayed by the requirement for the completion of a COMCAPREP. Where
   the Capturing Unit has the ability to categorise PW/Detainee this should be
   done and the category noted in the COMCAPREP. Reports are originated at the
   unit level, staffed through their respective HQ.
4. **Format of the COMCAPREP**. The format of the COMCAPREP is below:

**COMCAPREP Template**

CAPTURED PERS INTERNMENT SERIAL NUMBER
```

1. **Allocation of CPERS Internment Serial Numbers (ISN)**. Every CPERS is
   allocated a unique serial number to enable his identification and tracking by
   the PW Holding Organisation (PWHO) throughout the period of his internment.
   The ISN represents various items of data about the CPERS and an explanation
   of the content of the ISN is set out in this Appendix to enable the ISN to be
   read and, if necessary, to be generated without the assistance of IT.
2. **Explanation of the ISN 14-Character Alphanumeric Group**. The breakdown of
   the characters is as follows:

a. Positions 1 and 2 - Country Codes. STANAG 1059 contains a listing of
two-character alphabetic codes representing every country in the world. It also
contains a cross reference to the two and three letter International Standards
Organization codes used by the ICRC. AS, NZ, US, FJ, JN, MY, TH and ID are the
primary country codes for the TCN members of CJTF 667.

b. Positions 3 and 4 - Superior Unit or Formation Identifying Codes. A two
character alphanumeric code representing the unit or formation to which the
capturing unit is subordinate. These Codes will be promulgated by the relevant
higher command for the particular operation. For OP STEEL SENTINEL, 3L will
represent CJTF 667.

c. Positions 5 to 10 - Number. A six digit roll up number generated by the unit
or Prisoner of War Records Unit (PWRU) allocating the ISN (100000-199999 for 1
ID, 200000-299999 for JFLCC, 300000-399999 for JFMCC, 400000 - 499999 for ESG
and 500000 and up controlled by CJTF 667).

d. Positions 11 and 12 – Identifying Nation. A two character alphabetical code
from STANAG 1059/AJP 2.5 identifying the nation to which the CPERS owed
allegiance (e.g. NT for North Torbia)

e. Position 13 –Status. A single character indicating the status of the CPERS as
follows:

```
Value Meaning
O Officer
S Other Rank
M Retained Medical
Personnel
R Retained Religious
Personnel
C Civilian
```

```
AD2-2/2
```

f. Position 14 –Gender Code. A single character indicating the sex of the CPERS:

```
Value Meaning
F Female
M Male
```

3. **Example of an Internment Serial Number**. An ISN of AS XX100864NTSM
   translates as:

```
a. AS - Australia is the capturing nation.
b. XX Capturing Unit was under full command of X Bde.
c. 100864 A unique number from a block allocated to the unit.
d. NT The CPERS owes his allegiance to Ariana.
e. S The CPERS is a Non-Commissioned Member.
f. M The CPERS is male.
```

4. Returns on used Internment Serial Numbers are due to the CJTF 667 PM on a
   daily basis.

**NOTE: Although NATO ISN numbers were developed for CPERS with a PW status
only, CJTF 667 will use this ISN format to include all CPERS to include those
that are not categorized as PW.**

**Situation**

1. Operation STEEL SENTINEL is the codeword allocated to the ADF operation to
   counter the threat to Australian (AS) interests and Belesia (BX) sovereignty
   from North Torbian (NT) and Olvanan (OV) aggression. CDF advised the minister
   of defence that NT had begun preparations that would place North Torbian
   (NTMF) and Olvana Military Forces (OVMF) in a position to be able to threaten
   BX sovereignty. Analysis indicated that military action against BX in the
   immediate future is probable. As a result, the Government of BX (GOBX) has
   requested Government of Australia (GOAS) assistance/military intervention to
   counter the direct threat from NTMF and OVMF.
2. Concern lies around Palawan (PAL) for its use as a staging post for further
   NTMF military action against BX, particularly noting the landing of advance
   forces during biennial exercise RISEN SWORD with OVMF. As a result, all
   commanders are to have a good understanding of Ref E and how it applies to OP
   STEEL SENTINEL.
3. In keeping with Refs E-I and Ref D, a significant gender concern lies in
   possible humanitarian violations throughout the conflict of OP STEEL
   SENTINEL. A number of key issues, obtained from Ref D, are to be noted by
   Commanders and force elements throughout the conduct of OP STEEL SENTINEL:

a. Medium levels of gender based domestic violence, not only throughout BX and
the AIG, but specifically on Palawan have been historically evident. In times of
armed conflict, incidents have been seen to increase.

b. The possible increase in Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) noting the
already high levels of domestic violence in the region. Although BX is a
signatory of the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination
against Women; instances continue to occur with limited reporting.

```
AE-2/5
```

c. Significant presence of Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), welfare groups
including CARE, UNHCR and the Red Cross may already be in country. These groups
will be able to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the situation and any
gender issues, and are to be engaged to gain a full understanding of the
situation. This will allow BX to continue to maintain sovereignty, utilising ADF
assets in an assistance role. In all instances DFAT are to be liaised with to
ensure alignment with government intent.

**Mission**

4. On Order, the ADF is to deploy to the area in order to counter the threat to
   BX sovereign territory and restore regional security and stability.

**Execution**

5. IAW Ref A, the mission end state is that NT and OV threat to BX sovereign
   territory is negated. This evolved from the establishment of a sufficiently
   secure and stable environment in the occupied BX islands and improved
   capability of BX security forces such that state-sponsored hostilities have
   ceased, territorial borders are secure, humanitarian assistance programs
   operate unhindered and transition to a UN-sanctioned and/or HN follow- on
   security force is complete.

**Groupings and Tasks**

6. It is anticipated OP STEEL SENTINEL will be conducted in five phases
7. **Phase 0 - Shaping**.

a. Force Elements are to conduct pre-deployment training on Gender awareness to
all personnel, with focus on the mandatory reporting requirements as outlined
later in this document.

b. Allocated a GENAD in the Operational Manning Document. The GENAD is to be a
special advisor to command on the implementation of the gender perspective into
planning, execution and assessment of ongoing operations, including
Participation, Prevention, Protection and Perspective IAW Ref E. The GENAD is to
be allocated in the J0 branch.

c. Force Elements are to appoint Gender Focal Points (GFP) such that gender is
considered at all levels of planning and integration throughout the operation,
providing feedback to the GENAD as appropriate

d. JTF 667 is to identify key stakeholders in the AO, and through DFAT,
instigate liaison to ensure the execution of the operation is in keeping with
the local government intent.

e. Collection of data including but not limited to sexual disaggregated data,
cultural considerations and breakdowns and health statistics.

f. A Gender Analysis is to be completed and included in the planning phase to
ensure all avenues are considered and an emphasis is placed on PNG self-ability
rebuild.

```

a. All units, force elements and headquarters are to continue to monitor and
report, ensuring a gender perspective is placed on all operations conducted
within the region.

b. An ongoing gender analysis is conducted, particularly noting the concerns
raised in Para 2 and 3. This will be important, with a focus on the ability to
empower the local population through a gender perspective to promote
self-sustainability.

c. Be prepared to conduct NEO operations IAW Ref L, liaising closely with DFAT
and other key stakeholders in any subsequent planning or operation, ensuring a
gender perspective is applied at all times.

9. **Phase 3 - Neutralise.**

progresses.

b. Composition of Key Leadership Engagement teams, patrol and stationing teams
are to consider the gender focus. They are to be generated to include female
representation as appropriate.

c. Maintain engagement with key stakeholders to ensure consistent gender
messaging and actions are conducted throughout.

d. A gender perspective is to be applied to all kinetic and non-kinetic targets,
both deliberate and dynamic, to ensure consistent messaging and promoting PNG
sovereignty.

e. Continue to liaise with host nation to support nation building in preparation
for transition to phase IV.

f. Be prepared to conduct pastoral care support to own forces in the event of
humanitarian crimes incident.

10. **Phase 4 – Transition**

a. Continue to provide support and training to host nation in gender awareness
and maintaining a gender perspective.

b. Continue engagement with NGO and key stakeholders to support progression to
UN mission

Aug 2020

**Background**

1. The Australian Defence Force has historically enjoyed a close working
   relationship with the Belesian Armed Forces. Part of this successful
   bilateral agreement has been the biennial exercises conducted between the
   Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Belesian Navy (BN), under the auspice of
   Exercise FLOATING FORTRESS. The most recent iteration, FLOATING FORTRESS
   2018, saw the BN and RAN conduct 3 weeks of increasingly intensive Maritime
   interdiction and warfare scenarios off the coast of Darwin. These exercises
   have increased interoperability between the two Navies, whilst continuing to
   provide support and stability to the region. These exercises are seen as key
   in strengthening international relations, whilst providing training to both
   the RAN and BN commensurate to counter any perceived ongoing threat.
2. An increase of North Torbian (NT) armed forces has been observed over the
   previous years, as has an increase in bilateral exercises with Olvana (OV).
   The increase in military armament, particularly from a maritime perspective,
   has caused great concern amongst the Belesian Government. This is further
   compounded by a number of reclaimed islands off the coast of Panay, which
   have been claimed under the auspice of historical use. Complicated by the
   location of NT owned and operated oil and gas drilling rigs, what were once
   rocks and reefs in the region have been built to such a state that they can
   support runways, small ports and infrastructure to mount Coastal Defence
   Cruise Missiles (CDCM) sites. The foundation of the Cerium rare-earth mineral
   mine in Panay by Olvanan registered owners in the region of San Rafael has
   continued to cause concern amongst the Belesian Government, with sovereignty
   issues causing angst within the Belesian government. With the significant
   increase in military hardware by NT, and the increased ties to Olvanan
   Military, concern lies in an overt attempt to claim Panay by NT.
3. In order to maintain an overt presence within the region, it was agreed to by
   the Australian and Belesian Government’s that Exercise FLOATING FORTRESS 20,
   programmed to take place between 28 Sept – 23 Oct 20, would take place. The
   premise behind this was to ensure a military presence would remain in the
   area to dissuade any overt attempt by either NT or OV to claim the region. As
   contained within Ref C, the exercise was to provide mutual training
   opportunities to both RAN and BN units, increasing in complexity across all
   domains of

warfare. HMAS _Anzac_ is half-way through this exercise with a variety of
Belesian Observers and units, and is best placed to act as a forward liaison.

**Situation**

4. The situation remains IAW ref A. On 03 August 2020, a radical group from the
   local claiming to be in support of the local Panay government tried to seize
   the mine in San Rafael. This resulted in significant loss of life, primarily
   amongst the Belesian Constabulary, including an unknown number of miners and
   associated employees. Due to the mines close ties with the community, this
   unrest has overflowed to the nearby city of Roxas, resulting in a large
   number of ethnic based violence towards NT personnel, as they are seen as the
   aggressor having killed Belesian personnel.
5. NT and OV have been conducting Exercise RISEN SWORD in the nearby South China
   Sea, and it was under this guise that NT landed a battalion worth of
   personnel near the city of Roxas in order to quell the violence. This has
   resulted in the capture and subsequent loss of the airport, sea port and the
   San Rafael mine. In an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security
   Council, UNSCR 8868 condemning NT action was signed and promulgated.
   Subsequently NT instigated an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) and
   Maritime Exclusion Zone (MEZ) as described below. Further diplomatic channels
   have broken down, resulting in UNSCRs 8869, 8873 and raising the
   International Belesian Security Assistance Force (IBSAF) otherwise known as
   CJTF 667.
6. With this occurring during the conduct of EXERCISE FLOATING FORTRESS 20,
   _Anzac_ remains best place to provide an initial maritime presence on behalf
   of CJTF 667, with further supplementation as outlined in subsequent
   paragraphs and orders. Initial concern lies in the location and disposition
   of NT maritime units, and it remains unknown whether OV will render
   assistance to NT through maritime unit support. The known disposition of NT
   assets has been reported SEPCOR and will continue to be updated as the
   situation develops.

**Mission**

5. The CCJTF 667 mission is as follows:

_On order, CJTF 667 is to conduct military operations to expel all NT forces
from Belesian sovereign territory in order to create conditions for the
re-establishment of a safe and secure environment in Belesia and the surrounding
region_.

6. The Maritime Component Commander mission is as follows:

_On Order, TG 667.1 is to provide the necessary maritime effects to support the
military operations to expel all NT forces from Belesian sovereign territory. It
is to contribute to land and air missions as directed and be prepared to take
all measures necessary to expel NT maritime forces from the AO._

**Zones and Areas**

7. **Area of Operation**. The area of operation is IAW Ref A, and is bound by
   the area encompassing the top left corner XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE and bottom
   right corner of XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE.
8. **Maritime Exclusion Zone**. The claimed Maritime Exclusion Zone is not
   recognized by CCJTF667 and CTG 667.10. This area is bound by the area
   encompassing top left corner XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE and bottom right corner of
   XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE.
9. **Air Defence Identification Zone**. The claimed Air Defence Identification
   Zone is not recognized by CCJTF667 and CTG 667.10. This area is bound by the
   area encompassing top left corner XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE and bottom right
   corner of XX XX.XXS; YYY YY.YYE.

**Execution**

10. **Targetable Threats.** Noting the NT/OV exercise RISEN SWORD completed on
    02 Oct 20, it is anticipated significant resupply and maintenance will need
    to be completed by NT units before they can deploy into the area. Whilst
    this will initially have a complimentary effect on CJTF 667 maritime units,
    it is anticipated this benefit will begin to diminish as OP STEEL SENTINEL
    progresses.
11. Units are to adhere to the Rules of Engagement (ROE) in force at the time
    when conducting operations, and are not to act outside the active ROE at Ref
    G unless explicitly directed by CCJTF 667. The following threats are
    targetable whilst located within the AO:

a. Open hostilities by NT Forces towards civilians or CJTF 667 personnel

b. Open hostilities by OV forces towards civilians or CJTF 667 personnel

c. Prohibited imports and exports

d. Illegal Exploitation of Belesian Natural Resources by NT vessels

e. Illegal Activities in protected areas

f. Maritime Terrorism

g. Maritime operations that materially improve or safeguard NT hold on Belesian
sovereign territories examples are, but not limited to, mining or the
construction of coastal defences

h. Piracy, Violence or Robbery at Sea

12. At all times, the main effort is the restoration of Belesian territory
    sovereignty and a peaceful and stable environment.
13. Specific unit and task group direction will be provided via an OPGEN passed
    SEPCOR in order to provide the most current operational intent, instruction
    and guidance for on scene commanders to effectively complete the mission.
    These will be released by CTG 667.1 as required via secure military
    messaging. Further details will be passed in due course.

**Assigned Units**

14. IAW Ref A, the following units are anticipated to comprise TG 667.1 through
    the course of the Operation. Units will arrive and depart as described in
    the OPGEN, and via TASKORDs:

**Concept of Operations**

15. In order to maintain the objectives outlined within Refs A and D-F, it is
    anticipated the maritime component of OP STEEL SENTINEL will be broken into
    five phases. This will ensure there is consistency between all Land, Air and
    Maritime components, while being complimentary with Refs A and B. A maritime
    line of operation can be obtained at Appendix 1
16. **Phase 0 – Shaping**. This phase will take place from now until ordered.
    This phase is to be considered the normal state of affairs and as such, no
    overt action is to be conducted without express authority or approval from
    CCJTF 667. Throughout the shaping phase, the following actions are to occur:

a. Conduct Exercise FLOATING FORTRESS. This is paramount in continuing the
presence operations being conducted in Belesian waters

b. Integration of BN through Exercise FLOATING FORTRESS and ad hoc engagements.
This is to provide a consolidated front and allows for smoother transition
through to Transition Phase

c. Establishment HQ JFMCC base of operations in Zamboanga.

d. Embark CTG elements in units as required for Exercise FLOATING FORTRESS with
repatriation to HQ JFMCC on completion of the exercise, or as required

e. Units as directed BPT conduct maritime presence and force protection of
designated shipping

f. Units as directed to assume to 48hrs notice to embark personnel, equipment
and stores as required for amphibious lodgment in follow on phasing

17. Phase 0 will be complete when ordered by CCJTF 667, or should hostilities
    from NT or OV forces occur towards CJTF 667 personnel or civilians
18. **Phase 1 – Denial**. This phase will commence on order, and will be used to
    secure the necessary maritime approaches to Panay, whilst negating NT
    military influence over the region. Tasks are as follows:

a. Units to continue to support BN activities to counter NT influence within
Panay.

b. Units as directed embark personnel, equipment and stores required for
amphibious lodgment, commencing transit on order.

c. Units as directed conduct Force Integration Training (FIT) enroute to JFAO

d. Units as directed sail to conduct shaping operations within the JFAO

e. Units to secure necessary Sea Lines of Communication as directed within the
JFAO

f. Units as directed secure local sea control of designated areas within the
JFAO in preparation for follow on tasking

g. Units to conduct ASW surveillance in order to sufficiently threat reduce the
likelihood of the presence of unfriendly sub-surface units within the JFAO

h. Units BPT secure local air control of designated areas ISO TF 640 tasking and

19. Phase 1 will be completed once Sea Lines Of Communication (SLOC), Air Lines
    Of Communication (ALOC) are achieved, directed local Sea and Air Control is
    achieved and forces are positioned to conduct an amphibious landing onto
    Panay ISO IBSAF.
20. **Phase 2 – Lodgment**. This phase will commence on order and involve the
    lodgment of amphibious units onto Panay to support Belesian Armed Forces.
    Tasks are as follows:

a. Continue to integrate BN elements into CJTF 667 operations to support smooth
transition to stability operations

b. On order, units are to establish Amphibious Operating Area

c. On order, units are to commence lodgment of ground forces at designated APOD
and SPOD

d. Neutralise NT maritime elements in order to maintain local Sea Control of
designated areas

e. Neutralise NT air elements in order to maintain local Air Control ISO TG 640
operations

f. Units as directed BTP neutralize NT maritime, air and land elements as
required to support amphibious lodgment and SLOC/ALOC maintenance

g. Units as directed BPT support littoral operations in support of ground forces

h. Units as directed BPT employ deception measures, including feints, displays,
demonstrations, ruses and other means as directed by CCJTF 667

i. Units as directed BPT conduct Freedom of Navigation Operations

j. Units as directed BPT conduct HADR support

21. Phase 2 is complete when ground forces have been successfully lodged, or the
    requirement for lodgment is negated due to NT forces withdrawing from Panay.

22. **Phase 3 – Neutralisation**. This phase will commence on completion of the
    amphibious operation, and will encompass the expelling of NT military
    elements from Panay in concert with Belesian military forces. Tasks are as
    follows:

a. Neutralise NT maritime assets within the JFAO

b. Maintain established SLOC

c. Maintain established ALOC ISO TG 640 operations

d. Maintain local Sea Control of designated areas

e. Maintain sustainment operations of CJTF 667 forces, including refueling, re-
ammunition and victualling as required to sustained maintain operations

f. Units as directed BPT support littoral operations in support of ground forces

g. Units as directed to conduct mine clearance operations

h. Units as directed BPT conduct Freedom of Navigation Operations

i. Units as directed BPT conduct HADR support

23. Phase 3 will be completed when NT maritime forces have been expelled from
    the JFAO and conditions are set to transition to local stability and
    enforcement operations.
24. **Phase 4 – Transition**. This phase will commence on order, once all NT
    maritime elements have been expelled from the JFAO. This phase will work in
    conjunction with both TGs 667.2 and 640 to ensure Belesia is in a state to
    commence transition from CJTF 667 control to host nation control. Tasks are
    as follows: a. On order, commence redeployment of units including amphibious
    task group and non- essential maritime forces

b. Conduct maritime support operations in order to facilitate training and
consolidation of BN forces

c. On order, hand over OPCON of JFMCC functions to BN

d. Units as directed BPT conduct Freedom of Navigation Operations

e. Units as directed to conduct anti-piracy and maritime counter terrorism
patrols

f. Units as directed to conduct mine and unexploded ordnance clearance

g. Units as directed BPT conduct HADR support

25. Phase 4 will be completed once all CTG 667.1 units have redeployed to
    respective host nations and Belesian sovereignty and authority is restored
    to the island of Panay. Phase 4 may be extended as it is reliant on host
    nation support, however the intent is to not remain in a protracted
    situation outside the historical maritime interactions both nations have
    enjoyed.

**Operational End State**

26. The overall end state remains the neutralization of North Torbian
    aggression, the re- instatement of Belesian sovereignty over Belesian
    islands and region, and the transition to UN- sanctioned and/or HN follow-on
    security force is complete.

**Administration and Logistics**

27. All administration requirements are outlined within the respective annexes
    of Ref A. All units deploying are to ensure their personnel remain
    deployment ready (IR and MAAT compliant) as no waivers will be given for
    this deployment. Should units be unable to support missions IAW the relevant
    Operating and Support intent (OSI) document due to manning or equipment
    restrictions, they are to bring these to the attention of CTG 667.1 at the
    first available opportunity.
28. All logistics requirements will be outlined through respective orders, with
    further supplementation provided in due course. All units are to follow the
    logistic requirements as outlined in the respective annexes contained Ref A.
    Should any discrepancy occur concerns are to be raised through the
    appropriate command at first available opportunity.

**Command and Signal**

29. **Reporting Requirements**. Reporting requirements, including timings will
    be outlined within the respective OPGEN to be signaled SEPCOR. Reports are
    to be made via formal messaging format (OPREP) and followed by Sametime Chat
    messaging. Further clarification will be provided within the OPGEN.
    Notwithstanding, should any Commanding Officer be unsure as to whether an
    incident or activity needs to be reported, they are to contact JFMCC at
    first available opportunity.
30. **Tasking**. All tasking will occur through the use of Warning Orders,
    (WARNORDs), Execution Orders (EXECUTOs) and Tasking Orders (TASKORDs). These
    will be released as required throughout the course of OP STEEL SENTINEL by
    CTG 667.1 and JFMCC as appropriate. All units are to be cognizant they may
    be tasked IAW their OSI, and are to be ready to support to achieve the
    mission.
31. **Battle Rhythm**. A Battle Rhythm will be promulgated in the OPGEN. All
    units are to adhere to the reporting cycle as determined within the battle
    rhythm, as returns from units will have a direct impact on the ability to
    provide support to other CJTF 667 assets or operations. Information flow
    will be through the use of WIMS, DIMS and as required intelligence injects.
    As the operation matures the battle rhythm may change, and this will be
    coordinated through DIMs.

32. **Communications**. An OPTASK COMMS will be released by the senior ship
    prior to departure, with all units to ensure appropriate holdings as
    directed within the document. All units are to ensure they appropriately man
    national and coalition networks throughout the operation, reporting all
    defects or non-compliances through normal reporting chains

**Summary**

33. Operation STEEL SENTINEL marks an important display of joint and
    multi-national cooperation not only to North Torbia, but to the rest of the
    world. The maritime component is key in ensuring our land forces can not
    only achieve their objectives, but be confident that they can conduct
    operations uninhibited by maritime threats. The integration with Beleisan
    Naval forces throughout the entire operation is paramount, as they will be
    the custodians of Panay on completion. By providing support and guidance, we
    can ensure a peaceful and prosperous resolution, strengthening Belesian ties
    with the international community.

Rules of Engagement, of 09 Nov 2009 C. UN Security Council Resolution 8869 of
XXXXXXX D. UN Security Council Resolution 8873 of XXXXXXX

**General Principles**

1. **Introduction**. In the conduct of military operations, military forces are
   authorised to use force in self-defence, pursuant to authorised Rules of
   Engagement (ROE) or under the application of the Law of Armed Conflict. The
   right to use force in self-defence is universally considered to be an
   inherent right and is not restricted by ROE. The United Nations, has issued
   policy and military guidance on the strategic objectives for operations in
   Belesia. For the International Belesian Security Assistance Force (IBSAF), it
   has been decided to adopt NATO principles and procedures, with the Sanremo
   Manual for Rules of Engagement for the promulgation and amendment of ROE.
   General guidance in relation to NATO ROE, is set out in Ref A, with further
   clarification of Sanremo ROE at Ref B. The following ROE is issued under the
   authority of Commander Combined Joint Task Force 667 (CCJTF 667) for use by
   CJTF 667 during the conduct of OP STEEL SENTINEL.
2. **Authority**. The authority providing the legal framework for the operation
   is set out in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and the United
   Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) in accordance with Refs C and D.
   The current authority provides for IBSAF to take all necessary measures to
   carry out the tasks listed in UNSCRs 8869 and 8873.
3. **ROE Definition.** ROE are directives that define the circumstances,
   conditions, degree and manner, in which force or actions, which might be
   construed as provocative, may or may not be applied or taken. The ROE
   implemented for this operation provide the sole authority for IBSAF to use
   force. Although the ROE do not limit the inherent right of self-defence,
   different national approaches to the definition of self-defence may result in
   inconsistency between multinational forces as to where the right to use force
   in self-defence ends and the use of force authorised by the mission ROE
   package begins.
4. **Self-Defence.** Nothing in this ROE shall negate a commander’s right to
   take all necessary action for unit and individual self-defence.

a. Individuals and units have a right to defend themselves against attack or an
imminent attack. In exercising this right, individuals and units will act in
accordance with national law. Therefore more detailed and specific guidance from
Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) applicable for their respective forces will be
required. Self-defence is the use of such necessary and proportional force,
including deadly force, to defend against an attack or an imminent attack.

```
UNCLASSIFIED
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

The principles of necessity and proportionality, together with terms “imminent”
and “attack” defined in Ref. A para 7 will apply for all CJTF 667 forces.

b. Within the general concept of self-defence, JTF 667 forces have the right to
use force that is necessary and proportional to defend civilians accompanying
JTF 667 forces, including UN personnel, who have been taken hostage.

5. **Extended Self-defence.** Ref A stipulates, “In keeping with the principles
   of the Alliance, within the general concept of self-defence,
   Coalition/Coalition-led forces and personnel also have the right to take
   appropriate measures, including the use of necessary and proportional force
   to defend other Coalition/Coalition-led forces and personnel from attack or
   from imminent attack”. As regards “Coalition led forces”, UN has approved an
   interpretation that would include any IBSAF forces OPCON, TACOMD or TACON
   (for the time being) to Combined Joint Task Force-Operation 667 (CJTF 667)
6. **Application of ROE and the Use of Force.** Within this coalition for
   Operation STEEL SENTINEL, ROE are authorised by CCJTF 667 for use by the
   IBSAF. This implies that the chain of command has been involved and has taken
   the responsibility to disseminate them, ensure understanding, request
   clarifications and, seek amendments as required. The chain of command also
   assumes the responsibility to ensure compliance and determine
   incompatibilities. During the conduct of the operation the use of force
   principles described in Ref A para 10-12 apply.
7. **Applicable Law.** CJTF 667 forces are, by NATO and UN doctrine, following
   international law and reflect the ROE package requested. The IBSAF/CJTF 667
   mission must be communicated and perceived as being lawfully requested by the
   UN. CCJTF 667 will engage with non-military entities mitigating any incorrect
   perception of the Coalition presence in the Joint Force Area of Operations
   (JFAO) (once authority to coordinate is delegated). Simultaneously,
   coordinating efforts will be conducted at the strategic level, communicating
   the legitimacy of this UN-sanctioned operation.

a. **International Law.** The conduct of CJTF 667 forces is circumscribed by
international law, including the applicable principles derived from the Law of
Armed Conflict (LOAC). When applicable, CJTF 667 forces also have a
responsibility to obey other International treaties that affect military
operations. In particular, CJTF 667 forces must comply with the LOAC principles:
distinction, military necessity, proportionality, and humanity.

b. **National Laws.** TCNs shall adhere to their national laws. They are not
obliged to execute tasks or operations that would constitute a breach of their
national laws. Therefore, nations should issue national restrictions and/or
clarifying instructions in order to ensure compliance with national law. Any
such national clarifying instructions should be minimised and must not be more
permissive than the ROE authorised for this operation. When national laws are at
variance with the CJTF 667 ROE or a nation’s caveats or clarifying instructions
have the effect of limiting CJTF 667 ROE, nations must inform CCJTF 667 of any
inconsistencies as early as possible. The normal mechanisms for notification of
such national restrictions and/or clarifying instructions are FORCEPREP/Order of
Battle Transfer of Authority (ORBATTOA)

```
UNCLASSIFIED

**UNCLASSIFIED**

messages. In the case of sending enabling forces to the JFAO, TCN should
communicate their caveats prior to that, facilitating an initial package of ROE
being implemented for theater enablers. Where nations have expressed caveats on
involvement or the use of force, such caveats will be summarized and the
resultant impact on the mission identified. The full range of national caveats
held by IBSAF should be communicated to the operational level, analyzed and
applied as soon as possible. CJTF 667 Point of Contact (POC) for this activity
is the CJ35.

8. **Area of Responsibility.** These ROE will be extant for the area bounded by
   the following coordinates:

a. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

9. **Duty to Report.** Each situation resulting in a detention, or involving the
   use of deadly force, or use of riot control means (if authorised), whether it
   results in casualties or not, is to be reported through the chain of command
   as soon as possible.
10. **Avoidance of Collateral Damage**. In all cases, CJTF 667 forces should
    make every effort to minimize, to the maximum extent possible, any loss of
    life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects resulting from
    their use of force. Collateral damage shall never be deliberate, but is
    instead incidental to military action, even if foreseeable. The key is that
    such unintended damage must not be excessive or disproportionate to the
    military advantage to be gained from the specific act or attack.
11. **ROE Changes and Supplemental ROE**. The ROE authorised for the IBSAF are
    found below and implemented by CCJTF 667. Any limitation or restriction that
    is viewed as a potential threat to the safety of the force and/or the
    successful conduct of the mission should be addressed immediately upon
    discovery and reported up the chain of command. Supplemental ROE measures
    that may be required due to changes in the operational situation or
    otherwise may be submitted in a ROE Request Message (ROEREQ). This includes
    requests for ROE previously requested but denied, new or additional ROE.

**Time Zone Used Throughout the OPORD: ZULU.**

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. Growing ethnic tensions in the Belesian island of PANAY resulted
in violence when the local government in PANAY attempted to take control of the
lucrative Cerium rare earth mine in San Rafael from the Olvanan registered
operator. The resulting loss of life amongst the Belesian Constabulary and
unknown number of mine employees has sparked unrest in the nearby city of ROXAS.
Violence has occurred along ethnic lines with the greatest loss of life amongst
the Torbian diaspora. Olvana (OV) and North Torbia (NT) had been conducting a
week’s long biennial exercise in the South China Sea, named Exercise RISEN
SWORD. It was under the cover of this exercise that NT lodged an amphibious
force (estimated to be a Marine Brigade plus Divisional enablers) on Palawan
near the sparsely populated town of El Nido, capturing the port and airfield
facilities. Simultaneously, NT landed a Marine Expeditionary Force (estimated to
be the 3rd Marine BDE plus DIV enablers) near the city of ROXAS, PANAY and
captured the seaport, airport, and the San Rafael Mine. NT has claimed the
justification for this act of aggression is to protect ethnic Torbians in PANAY
from persecution. In addition, a pro-NT Visayan Peoples Front (VPF) insurgent
group has commenced insurgency operations ISO of NTMEF in PANAY. In response to
this blatant disregard for international protocols, the United Nations Security
Council (UNSC) passed UNSCR 8868 (ref A) condemning NT aggression and calling
for the withdrawal of NT Forces from Belesian territory. Concurrently, Belesia
(BX) landed a Brigade of troops in the south of PANAY through the city of ILOILO
in

```

an attempt to force the NT forces off the island. This course of action has
resulted in a stalemate with the NT Marine Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) holding
the northern half of PANAY centred on the city of ROXAS and SAN RAFAEL, and the
BX Forces holding the area around ILOILO. NT has since declared a Maritime
Exclusion Zone (MEZ) and Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the
occupied islands and parts of the Sulu and South China Sea. In an effort to
allow diplomatic options to be utilised and reduce further loss of life, the
UNSC passed UNSCR 8869 (ref B) calling on all Member States to enforce economic
and military sanctions against NT. With NT’s continued occupation of PANAY and
Palawan in contravention of International laws, the UNSC passed UNSCR 8873 (Ref
C) authorising the raising of the International Belesian Security Assistance
Force (IBSAF) to utilise military force to remove NT military elements on
sovereign Belesian territory. The Australian government has volunteered to be
the lead nation of the Combined Joint Task Force 667 (CJTF 667) with
contributing nations including New Zealand and Fiji. The Government of BX has
consented, subject to SOFAs (ref D), to allow CJTF 667 forces to stage through
their territories, to station forces, materiel and installations involved in
supporting its operations and to conduct overflights.

b. Strategic Aim. The aim of the international community is to:

```
(1) end North Torbian aggression towards Belesia
(2) expulsion of all North Torbian military forces from Belesian sovereign territory
(3) creation of a free, safe, secure and stable environment in the region
(4) continuation of Belesian democratic national governance and developmental
programs.
```

c. Strategic Objectives. In order to achieve the desired end state, the
strategic objectives of the international intervention include:

```
(1) Expel all North Torbian military forces from BX sovereign territory.
(2) Restore a secure and stable environment throughout the BX Joint Force Area of
Operations (JFAO).
(3) Effect force protection for coalition military forces deployed throughout the JFAO.
(4) Assist the government of BX to strengthen the capacities of their national security
forces and institutions to enforce central control.
(5) Preserve and enforce the freedom of navigation throughout the JFAO.
(6) Support UN Agencies, International Organizations (IOs) and NGOs within capabilities
and limitations in order to preserve human life and alleviate the suffering of IDPs and
refugees within the JFAO.
(7) Gradually reduce the size, role and profile of the IBSAF contribution. This process
will be guided by reviews of tasks, environment, threat, risks, follow-on forces and
Host Nation (HN) capacities as part of a Transition and Exit Strategy that is linked to
the achievement of the Desired Military Strategic End State.
```

d. Operational Objectives. With the support and agreement of the international
community, IBSAF has undertaken to end the crisis in BX by deploying a combined
joint task force to BX to

```
UNCLASSIFIED
```

```

UNCLASSIFIED
```

repel NT invading forces and restore BX territorial sovereignty. The force,
hereafter referred to as the Combined Joint Task Force 667 (CJTF 667) will
deploy under the authority of UNSCR 8873 (ref C). The objectives of this
military intervention are as follows:

```
(1) Establish military superiority in the maritime and airspace within the JFAO in a
manner which supports decisive operations.
(2) Conduct decisive military operations, which leads to the restoration of BX sovereignty
in the occupied islands; stabilise the region; and deter further external aggression
against BX.
(3) Assist humanitarian efforts and IO/NGO activities in BX.
(4) Assist the government of BX to re-establish and maintain a safe and secure
environment to facilitate the continuance of democratic government institutions and
programmes.
(5) Support any applicable International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations of crimes
against humanity through the preservation and collection of evidence.
```

e. To this end, a ground force, designated TG 667.2 is to deploy to the BX
island of PANAY to expel NTMEF from the island, defeat the ongoing insurgency
and to return control to the BX authorities.

f. Desired Operational End State. The Desired End State remains the
establishment of a sufficiently secure and stable environment on the island of
PANAY and improved capability of BX security forces such that state-sponsored
hostilities have ceased, irregular insurgency has been controlled and
territorial borders are secure, humanitarian assistance programs operate
unhindered and transition to an UN-sanctioned and/or HN follow-on security force
is complete. A safe and secure environment in PANAY exists when:

```
(1) Insurgency activities have ceased
(2) It allows IOs and NGOs safe and unrestricted access to the BX population.
(3) It encourages the return of IDPs and refugees.
(4) It fosters the rapid re-establishment of representative government institutions.
(5) It allows economic reconstruction and development.
```

g. Limitations.

```
(1) Constraints. In conducting its operations, TG 667.2 will:
A. Minimise the use of scarce BX resources.
B. Minimise collateral damage and civilian casualties on PANAY.
C. Deploy to the AO as soon possible in a sequence coordinated by CJTF HQ.
D. Work closely with the UN to facilitate the work of UN agencies, IOs and NGOs.
E. Operate in accordance with the SOFA with BX (r ef D).
(2) Restraints. In conducting its operations, TG 667.2 will not:
A. Adversely affect the civilian population of PANAY more than is required
```

```
B. Kinetically target the San Rafael mine complex.
C. Adversely effect the BX economy more than is necessary.
D. Disrupt port operations in ILOILO more than necessary.
E. Damage ROXAS infrastructure more than is necessary
```

h. Operational Areas.

```
(1) AO FANNING. The AO includes the landmass, national air space and territorial
waters of the BX island of PANAY (out to 12nm off the coast).
```

i. Threat Assessment. See Annex B, as well as the Country Studies at References
E to I inclusive for more detail.

```
(1) General. NT has projected forces onto the BX island of PANAY IOT control the
mineral resources, and to provide a viable alternate government that seeks to protect
the Torbian minority of PANAY.
(2) NTMEF located on PANAY. The principle land component of the NTMEF located on
PANAY is the 3 Marine BDE Task Group (BTG) supplemented with DIV troops. The
HQ is located in the city of ROXAS in the N of PANAY. One MAR BDET is in
mobile defence IVO the SAN RAFAEL mine, One MAR BDET is conducting mobile
defence IVO PASSI, a third MAR MBET is located in SARA, and the fourth is
defending IVO CUARTERO. The MAR Tank Bn is in reserve IVO ROXAS to CATK
any AS advance N from ILOILO or landing forces on the E coast. Recent intelligence
suggests that the 3 Marine BDE has been reinforced with a Tank Coy equipped with
T-72Bs. The NTMEF is positioned to prevent the return of control to the BX
authorities IOT to gain time to legitimise their occupation through Information
Warfare. 3 MAR BDE is supported by a BN size organisation of insurgents from the
Visayan Peoples Front:

j. Friendly Forces. TG 667.2 will operate within the established AO and will be
led by AS. TG 667.2 consists of a HQ, TU667.2.1 (X BDE), TU667.2.2 (Y BDE),
TU667.2.3 (16 AVN BDE), BX 12th BDE (OPCON) and DIV Troops. Other like-minded
nations may contribute forces or provide materiel support at a future date. As
Lead Nation, AS will provide critical force enablers. AS will partner with BX in
the provision of strategic-level support such as intelligence and logistics. The
composition of TG 667.2 is as follows:

```
(1) HQ.
A. Commander, Major General, XXXXXXXX, (AS).
B. Deputy Commander (Operations), Brigadier XXXXXXXXXX(AS).
(2) Task Unit 667.2.1 (X BDE).

(4) Task unit 667.2.3 (16 AVN BDE).
(5) DIV Enablers (see TASK ORG at Annex A)
(6) Belesian 12 INF BDE (Light) OPCON.
```

k. TG667.1.2 will provide naval vessels to complete the lodgement of TG 667.2 on
PANAY

l. TG667.1.1 will provide protection to TG 667.1.2 during the passage of sea
lines.

m. Detailed ORBAT is shown in Annex A.

n. International Organizations (IOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Some IOs and NGOs are currently operating in BX. Their presence is expected to
increase dramatically once a more secure operating environment is created. See
Annex Q of the Ref J for further details.

o. BX. BX has agreed to act as the HN to support the deployment and staging of
TG 667.2

p. Rotation of Forces. The timeframe for OSS is situation dependent. The initial
operating mandate provided by the UN is of 12 months duration, with extensions
as required. The initial force deployment is to be for 6 months. TCNs may plan
for the rotation of forces after that period of time.

2. **Mission.** TG 667.2 is to conduct lodgement and subsequent land operations
   to defeat all NTMEF forces in PANAY on order IOT to create conditions for
   expulsion of all NT forces from BELESIA.
3. **Execution.**

a. Commander’s Analysis. The occupation of Belesian sovereign territory and the
subjugation of Belesian citizens in PANAY by the North Torbian military is an
unacceptable act of aggression and will not be tolerated by the international
community. This act of aggression flies

```
UNCLASSIFIED
```

```
6
UNCLASSIFIED
```

in the face of international norms. To that end, TG 667.2 will land on and
conduct land combat operations within the BX island of PANAY IOT eject the NTMEF
currently located there. To date, this conflict has remained localised between
NT and BX. However, all subordinate commanders must understand that antagonising
other neutral regional countries through unrestricted use of force can escalate
into a wider conflict. It is important that our actions are conducted within
international guidelines and that in all planning considerations, utmost care is
taken to reduce collateral death and damage to non-combatants. Subordinate
commanders at all levels must be alert to these factors in the conduct of all of
their operations, particularly during the transition from combat operations.

b. Commander’s Intent. The Belesian Federation Defense Force (BFDF) is a capable
force that has the capacity to deal with the NT aggression effectively. However,
internal politics and the unstable nature of government institutions in this
young nation has meant that they have requested international support to assist
in dealing with NT aggression. Additionally, historic ethnic tensions between BX
central authority and the various ethnic groups, supported by an existing
insurgency in the occupied territories means that BX is not able to utilise
their capable military to deal with NT aggression effectively. TG 667.2,
supported by CJTF667, will utilise all forces within its command to meet the
UNSCR 8873 goal of removing NT military presence in PANAY and the establishment
of a safe and secure environment for the transition of authority back to BX.

A. Purpose: Defeat NTMEF and insurgency forces located on PANAY. B. Method:
Operation CERIUM STEAL will be a three-phase operation, with a preliminary
phase, nested within Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS). Phase 0 will see the
preparation of all ground forces for lodgment onto PANAY (including embarkation
on maritime assets). Phase 1 will consist of an amphibious and air lodgement of
the TG onto PANAY. Phase 2 will result in the Neutralisation of the NTMEF by
dislocating and then defeating them in battle. During Phase 2, X BDE will ADV N
and defeat NTMEF forces loc IVO of PASSI, and cut-off LoC to the alternate
APOD/SPOD in CATICLAN. This will dislocate the NTMEF forces IVO ROXAS and set
the conditions for Y BDE to decisively defeat these forces in detail and secure
ROXAS. Phase 3 will be the transition of authority back to the BX government. At
all times, we must be cognisant that the main effort is the removal of NT forces
in BX. If this can be achieved during any of the stages without further
bloodshed, then all effort must be taken to explore those options.

C. Endstate: The liberation of PANAY, removal of NTMEF forces, the establishment
of a safe and secure environment in PANAY, and the conditions set for a UN
supervised transition of authority to the BX Government.

c. Main Effort. The main effort is the defeat of NTMEF on PANAY by the capture
of ROXAS.

d. Centre of Gravity. The TG COG is assessed as being its manoeuvre units which
provide the mobility and firepower to overmatch and dislocate the lighter armour
of 3 MAR BDE

e. Concept of Operations. OP Cerium Steal will be conducted in three phases as
follows:

```

```

(6) PWs and Captured Persons (CPERS). Handling and disposition of PWs and CPERS
will be in accordance with to Annex AD to Ref J. AS has agreed to be Lead Nation
on the handling and disposition of PW and CPERS. A. National Responsibilities on
PW/CPERS. For reasons of National sensitivity and ownership of processes
relating to PW/CPERS, all Coalition personnel will respect their own national
procedures following guidelines in accordance with the Geneva Convention: B.
Custody of PW/CPERS. PW/CPERS operations are a National responsibility. As such,
it is imperative that all persons detained by Coalition personnel remain in the
care and custody of authorised personnel only. It is understood that operational
requirements may force acceptance of PW/CPERS from, or transfer to, other Allied
nations of the Coalition. This shall be the exception and not the norm. Should
such circumstance become necessary, only the respective National Commander or
his designated representative can authorize the acceptance or transfer of a
PW/CPERS to or from another nation. C. Treatment. PW and CPERS are to be treated
in accordance with all accepted international laws and conventions. D. Transfer
or Release. Although tactical situations may oblige commanders to detain persons
during the conduct of operations, it is the responsibility of National
Commanders at all levels to determine who will be categorised as a CPERS and
immediately field release all others. Once a determination has been made to
further retain the detained person and a PW/CPERS number has been assigned, only
the National Commander of the capturing nation has the authority to release or
transfer PW/CPERS to other nations. For the specific purpose of an individual
clearly detained as a PW, there is no requirement to determine status upon
capture, as PW are captured enemy combatants and remain in detention for the
duration of hostilities. The detaining power has an obligation to make a
determination of PW versus other CPERS status as soon as practical after
capture.

```
E. PW and CPERS Reporting. In accordance with national directives, all PW or
CPERS in Coalition custody shall be reported via official means by using a
PW/CPERS Capture Report.
F. PW/CPERS Holding Facilities. TG 667.2 will establish holding facilities in
PANAY. The locations of facilities will be reported to CJTF667 when established.
This facility is to be considered temporary until declared otherwise by CJTF667
HQ.
(7) Reports and Returns. The Battle Rhythm schedule for Reports and Returns will be
published once the HQ CJTF 667 has declared OPRED.
```

4. **Admin and Logistics (Sustainment).**

a. Outline Concept.

```
(1) Sustainment support to TG 667.2 will be coordinated and led by HQ TG 667.2 in
conjunction with JFLOGCC. While TCNs retain overall responsibility for the
sustainment of national formations and units, JFLOGCC retains coordinating
authority.
(2) HQ TG 776.2 will establish a Theater Support Area (TSA) within PANAY adjacent to
the SPOD/APOD (ILOILO) in order to execute sustainment operations. Additional
logistic nodes will also be set up as required such as at COLLINSVILLE once the
ATG has lodged. Sustainment support during OSS Ph 2-4 to forward FE will be the
responsibility of organic logistic FE through JFLOGCC coordination. Annex R to Ref
J will provide more details.
(3) HQ TG 667.2 will draw additional logistic support from JFLOGCC as required.
(4) TG 667.2 will deploy to PANAY with sufficient Op stock for 15 days. TU will deploy
with sufficient for 10 days.
```

b. Movements. Movement forward into PANAY post D-Day will be coordinated by
JFLOGCC HQ. Movement within PANAY will be coord by HQ TG 667.2

c. Medical Support. The concept of Health Support (HS) is detailed within the
Health Support Order (HSO) at Annex AA to Ref J. HS to TG 667.2 will be provided
by ADF and Coalition medical capabilities coordinated by the CJTF 667 J07. HQJOC
J07 retains overall technical control (TECHON) for all health care delivery on
an overseas operation. While TCN will deploy with limited integral HS and retain
responsibility for definitive care of their troops, provision of deployed HS to
Coalition and HN personnel may occur IAW the Medical Rules of Eligibility
(MEDROE) detailed in the HSO.

```
(1) Role 1 HS will be provided by ADF and Coalition integral capabilities.
(2) Role 2 and Role 2 (Enhanced) HS will be provided by deployment of health services
personnel into ILOILO.

coordinated by HQ TG 667.2 in conjunction with HQ CJTF 667 J6, but contracted
independently by TCN.
(4) Network Operations.
A. Defensive Measures. TG 667.2 networks are targets for Computer Network
Attack (CNA) by enemy seeking to sabotage or exploit coalition information or
services. The primary vulnerabilities are through gateways with external systems
and inadvertent transfer of viruses from open systems. All contributing nations are
responsible for effective COMSEC and Computer Network Defence (CND) on all
national networks and systems; these measures are vital for effective C2 and the
maintenance of information dominance. TG 667.2 J6 is responsible for the
coordination of defensive measures and COMSEC for all TG 667.2 systems
through the Network Operations Center located with HQ TG 667.2 (deployed).
B. Offensive Measures Offensive network operations or Computer Network Attack
(CNA) will not be conducted by coalition partners against adversary networks
without approval of COMD CJTF 667.

**INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT PLAN**

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: Zulu.**

1. **Situation**

a. Characteristics of the Operational Environment (OE).

```
(1) See Appendix 4 and ODIN.
```

b. Enemy.

```
(1) Under the stated aim of “liberating ethnic Torbians from the oppressive governance of
the Belesian government”, North Torbia (NT) invaded the Belesian (BX) islands of
Palawan and Panay with the NT Marine Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) landing on
Palawan on ( insert date ) and Panay on (insert date). The NTMEF utilised the cover of a
biennial exercise with Olvana (Ex RISEN SWORD) to muster forces to commence their
OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, the annexation of Panay. The first phase of OP
RIGHTEOUS HARMONY saw the landing of NTMEF elements to capture an old
airfield and seaport in the north Palawan town of El Nido. Utilising El Nido as a logistic
staging base, within 24hrs NT landed (utilising amphibious and heli-borne troops) and
captured the seaport, airport and other key locations of the northern Panayan city of
Roxas. A few months earlier, Roxas was the scene of rioting, which resulted in the
deaths of over one hundred ethnic Torbians. Little effective resistance was encountered
during the capture of El Nido and Roxas. It is estimated that the NTMEF has landed a
Marine Brigade Task Group (4th Marine BTG) in El Nido and established a logistic
node to support operations on Panay. The NTMEF HQ is also identified to have setup in
El Nido to better coordinate C2 and sustainment operations. The NTMEF is estimated to
have landed a reinforced Marine Brigade Task Group (3rd Marine BTG) in Panay.
Shortly after taking control of Roxas, the 3rd Marine BTG has advanced south to
Charters Towers and Ravenswood and established a defensive line. Conveniently, this
defensive line incorporates the San Rafael Mine complex, a key strategic asset in Panay
that produces a large quantity of rare earth metals, notably Cerium.
(2) In response to the capture of Roxas, the Belesian Federation Defence Forces (BFDF)
landed a Brigade (12th Infantry Bde) in the southern Panayan city of Iloilo. The 12th Bde
is a light infantry unit, so could be deployed at a relatively short notice. However, the 12
Bde does not have the combat power to defeat the NTMEF 3rd Marine BTG. Initial
advances north from Iloilo by the BFDF 12th Bde were stopped short of the NTMEF
defensive line which has since resulted in a stalemate with the majority of the 12th Bde
holding defensive positions around Iloilo to secure the sea and airport.
(3) The NTMEF has declared a Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) over northern Palawan, half of
Panay and the sea and air lanes connecting the two islands. The NTMEF has reinforced
their hold in Palawan and Panay with SU-30MKK fighter-bombers, and J-11B fighters,
along with active patrolling in the Sulu Sea between Palawan and Panay. Aside from
organic elements within the two NTMEF Marine BTGs, there have been reports of HQ-
16 SAMs, 122mm MLR batteries and other NTMEF Division troops in El Nido and
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
Roxas. It appears that not all NT Marine Expeditionary Division elements have been
deployed to Palawan or Panay. The remaining two Marine BTGs are reported to still be
in North Torbia and it is estimated that the NT armed forces do not want to escalate this
conflict wider. These two Marine BTGs may also be kept back as a strategic reserve to
reinforce the deployed Marine BTGs as required. Identified NT Naval elements
patrolling the sea-lanes within the declared TEZ include 1x Type 052D (Luyang III)
destroyer, 2x Type 052C (Luyang II) destroyers, 1x Type 051G (Luda) destroyer, 2x
Type 054A (Jiangkai II) frigates, 1x Type 053H3 (Jiangwei II) frigate, and 2x Type 053
(Jianghu V) frigates. Whilst not observed, it is assessed that an unknown number of up
to three Song class diesel-electric submarines (SSG) are operating in and around the
sea-lanes between Palawan and Panay. Combat Air Patrols of fighter aircraft have been
observed operating out of El Nido and Roxas in addition to rotary wing traffic of Z9
helicopters.
```

(4) Overall, the NTMEF are well trained and capable of conducting combined arms
and joint operations and are capable of limited power projection in the region.
The land forces of the NTMEF are designed for quick deployment and are therefore
lacking in heavier armour, but make up for this deficiency in a larger number of
combat units within each Marine BTG. It is expected that the 3rd Marine BTG in
Panay has been augmented with additional Divisional troops such as a Tank Coy of
T-72Bs, an MRL Battery, an HQ-16 SAM AD Battery and significant Engineer troops.
Similarly, the NTMEF maritime and air capabilities are also substantial and
capable with several platforms of Tier 1 or 2 capability (<15 years old).
Additionally, all NTMEF assets are under a unified command similar to a JTF
based on the Marine Division HQ. It is noted that NT has significantly more
forces on the mainland, but is postured along the North and South Torbian
border. NT sees a conflict with South Torbia (Republic of Torbia - RT) as the
more dangerous possibility and will keep the bulk of its forces poised for a
possible RT attack. Consequently, we can expect that NT’s considerable strike
capabilities on the mainland will not be utilised in the conflict in BX as they
are held in reserve for a possible RT attack.

(5) Enemy Strengths

```
(a) General. NT maintains the second largest military of the five Pacific countries, only
behind Olvana. Militarily, it is a dominant actor within the region, capable of
conducting military action across the spectrum of operations. The NT military
conducts overt, covert, and clandestine operations with ripple effects across the
region. Reporting also suggests ties between elements of NT’s military and criminal
and terror groups within the region, which further extends the potential for a global
threat.
(b) Army. The Torbian People’s Army (TPA) is the largest and most influential of the
NT Armed Forces. With compulsory national service, the TPA has a large number
of military trained personnel from which to draw upon. This reflects the stated
nature of the TPA goal as the reunification of the two Torbias. The bulk of the TPA
is located within the Southern and Northern Commands. The Western Command
has the only credible non-land based power projection capability through the NT
Marine Division. This Marine Division reflects the NT shift to power projection
and is therefore well equipped with Tier 1, 2 and 3 equipment. The Marine Division
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
is slightly different to other TPA Divisions in that it has more Mechanised Infantry
Battalions per Brigade (4 vs 3). However, this is offset by having lighter armoured
vehicles than their non-marine counterparts.
(c) Air Force. The Torbian Peoples Air Force (TPAF) is a capable organisation that is
able to strike any targets within the region. The TPAF has two squadrons of TU-22
bombers that can reach any target within the JFAO. However, these assets are kept
in strategic reserve and are primarily postured to counter any attack by South
Torbia. Instead, for OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, two squadrons of J-11 fighters
and two squadrons of SU-30MKK fighter-bombers have been allocated to support
the NTMEF. Additional AEW&C, surveillance and tanker support is provided. One
squadron of J-11 and SU-30MKK is operating out of El Nido, with the other
squadrons operating out of the Roxas airport.
(d) Navy. In recent years, the Torbian Peoples Navy (TPN) has greatly expanded its
maritime capability. In order to project power and maintain logistic support, the
TPN has provided significant support to OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY. The focus
of the TPN in support of the NTMEF is to secure the sea-lanes in and around the
contested islands of Panay and Palawan. The single Luyang III destroyer assigned
to the NTMEF is a significant threat to all aircraft in the TEZ. The NTMEF also
recognises the importance of the Luyang III and has kept this ship in the South
China Sea to secure the link between NT and El Nido, but also out of harm’s way
from possible RT attack.
```

(6) Enemy Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities.

```
(a) Army. The terrain (tropical) of Panay and Palawan means that travel of armoured
vehicles is restricted during the wet season and will tend to canalize ground forces
along MSRs. The availability of engineer assets to support maneuverability is
limited within the NTMEF. It is expected that the 3rd Marine Brigade will have
limited engineer support assets. This is alleviated somewhat with the amphibious
and light armour nature of the NTMEF. This light amphibious armour nature of the
NTMEF will mean that the use of heavy armour by friendly forces will provide
overmatch in most tactical situations. The 3rd Marine BTG has recently been
reinforced by a Tank Coy from the 6th Mech Division (Southern Army) consisting
of T-72B MBT.
(b) Air Force: In the event of full-scale combat engagement by modern air forces, the
TPAF would not be able to accomplish more than local air parity for a short period.
The TPAF ability to project force against NT’s neighbors is not only a source of
national prestige but represents a significant investment on the part of the National
Command Authority (NCA). The NT NCA is unlikely to risk more than a token
loss to a superior force. The training and equipment of the TPAF is below the level
of CJTF 667. Additionally, any strike aircraft from mainland NT will have to fly a
circuitous route along the South China Sea avoiding Sth Torbian (RT) airspace,
which will reduce their ability to dominate the TEZ. Instead, the TPAF will have to
rely on forces staged out of Palawan and Panay in order to maintain dominance
over the TEZ.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(c) Navy. The TPN has a relatively long line of communication from Panay, through
Palawan back to NT. The TPN ability to enforce the TEZ will be limited in the
relatively close waters of the north Sulu Sea. Being close to RT waters also means
that they will have concerns regarding RT naval vessels monitoring their
movements. Finally, the TPN has invested heavily in its naval vessels and will be
reluctant to expose these assets to complete loss. Hence, it is expected that their
most valuable naval surface vessels will likely remain in the South China Sea with
lower tiered vessels operating in the Sulu Sea (with the exception of their SSGs).
(7) Enemy Courses of Action (COAs)
(a) Most Likely Course of Action. The strategic goal of the NT occupation of Panay
and Palawan is for a political solution to foster Panayan independence under NT
sponsorship and not to escalate the conflict further. This means that at the strategic
level, NT will be careful not to portray itself as an occupying aggressor. It is likely
that NT will limit its military presence on Panay and Palawan to that of a Marine
Division and supporting maritime and air elements. It is highly unlikely that NT
will reinforce the Marine BTG on Panay with significant additional ground
elements, but holding enough combat power to deter or defeat any offensive attacks
by Coalition Forces. In the event of CF landing ground forces on Panay, the
NTMEF will utilise SPF and local insurgents to disrupt TG 667.2 activities before
using maneuver and fortified defensive positions to defeat or cause attrition to TG
667.2 elements. The NTMEF will continue to maintain the TEZ with combat air
patrols and surface warship patrols. They will remain in a defensive posture until
hostilities commence. Additionally, the NTMEF will likely aim to cause attrition of
TG 667.2 in order to force a diplomatic solution. The NTMEF will use information
warfare to discredit TG 667.2 and BX Defense Forces, challenge the legitimacy the
BX government, tell its “liberation of ethnic Torbians” story and promote its claim
to support Panayan independence.
(b) Most Dangerous Course of Action. The NTMEF will reinforce the ground forces on
Panay with an additional Marine BTG (likely the 2nd Marine BTG as the 1st is
currently under strength and on a lower readiness cycle). With that amount of
combat power, the NTMEF may be able to capture the southern city of Iloilo and
occupy the entire island of Panay. If Coalition Forces have been successful in
degrading NTMEF capability prior to ground operations, the NTMEF may commit
to capturing Iloilo with just the 3rd Marine BTG or commit to attacking TG 667.2
ground forces before the Land Component can commence offensive operations on
Panay. The NTMEF will use information warfare to discredit TG 667.2 and BX
Defense Forces, challenge the legitimacy of the BX government, tell its “liberation
of ethnic Torbians” story and promote its claim to support Panayan independence.
```

c. Friendly Forces.

```
(1) Coalition Intelligence Capability. Coalition intelligence organizations, including those
nested within the CJTF will provide all-source intelligence utilising all possible means,
including the establishment of a Multi-National intelligence operations center that will
serve as a central all-source intelligence fusion center supporting operations in the
JFAO.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

2. **Mission**

a. TG 667.2 intelligence conducts intelligence operations in order to enable
operations against the 3rd Marine BTG and affiliated groups in Panay.

3. **Execution**

a. Concept of Intelligence Operations. TG 667.2 intelligence will conduct
intelligence support to operations to enhance Indications and Warning (I&W) and
situational awareness in the region. Intelligence support will focus along three
lines of effort to achieve objectives in BX. Priority Intelligence Requirements
(PIRs) will be modified to support emerging operations and will drive
intelligence operations during the execution of this plan.

b. Purpose. TG 667.2 intelligence will support a long term, comprehensive
approach. Intelligence assessments must account for and connect all factors
within the political, military, economic, social, infrastructural, information,
physical environment and time domains (PMESII- PT) - and actors influencing the
dynamics in the Div Area of Interest (AOI). The main priorities are to provide
threat I&W to Coalition forces, identify and exploit opportunities that achieve
optimal results against the enemy, and provide kinetic and non-kinetic targeting
information leading to mission success.

c. Method. TG 667.2 intelligence capabilities organise and conduct intelligence
operations that drive collection, production and analysis, contributions to
target development, reporting, and collaboration with partners to provide timely
and actionable support to TG 667.2 while maintaining support to the Coalition’s
ongoing operations in the AO. In order to achieve this, the TG 667.2
intelligence architecture must synchronize and share information that produces
comprehensive intelligence assessments. Working with partner nations, TG 667.2
will employ all intelligence capabilities and provide timely and relevant
intelligence in order to support operations. Three primary intelligence Lines of
Effort complement each other and remain constant throughout each phase of the
operation.

```
(1) Intelligence Lines of Effort (LOEs).
(a) Intelligence Line of Effort I – ISR and Collection. This line of effort focuses on
collection coordination of Coalition ISR capabilities across the JFAO. This LOE
seeks to synchronize the collection effort in order to satisfy operational and
intelligence requirements and continue to update and refine the operational
environment. LOE I monitors the JFAO and AOI for I&W, builds situational
awareness, supports targeting operations, and conducts battle damage assessments
(BDA).
(b) Intelligence Line of Effort II – Analysis and Production. This LOE is designed to
ensure a common comprehensive understanding of the operational environment and
to support kinetic and non-kinetic targeting operations within the JFAO. LOE II
focuses on multisource analysis encompassing PMESII-PT, which satisfies
operational, and intelligence requirements.
(c) Intelligence Line of Effort III – Information Sharing. LOE III enables a
comprehensive Coalition approach to defeat the NTMEF. This LOE seeks to ensure
information sharing to the maximum extent possible allowed or in accordance with
each partner nation’s perspective, national policies and laws. Information sharing is
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
critical to this effort and must be placed within key nodes of Coalition intelligence
enterprise.
```

(2) Intelligence Phasing.

```
(a) Intelligence Support to TG 667.2. Intelligence support to TG 667.2 to defeat the 3rd
Marine BTG is tied to the four operational phases of OP CERIUM STEAL. This
section will identify the main activities of intelligence support LOEs and integrate
them into each respective phase.
```

1. Phase 0 – Shaping. During this Phase, the main effort of intelligence
   operations will be to support ISR collection efforts. This phase will see the
   deployment of critical advance force operation assets along with the
   utilization of HUMINT, SIGINT and other intelligence gathering assets to
   confirm 3rd Marine BTG force disposition and intent, and inform the targeting
   process. The intelligence effort will also support the CJTF main effort of
   non-kinetic shaping operations.
2. Phase 1 – Lodgement. The main effort for intelligence operations during this
   phase will be to continue to analyse information from all sources to support
   the lodgement of ground forces into Panay. It is important that I&W for NTMEF
   movement and intent be closely monitored. This is a critical phase of
   operation, as failure to achieve lodgement into Panay will mean the overall
   failure of the mission. Joint intelligence assets will also support the TG
   667.2 deception plan of staging amphibious forces off Panay to make the NTMEF
   believe the TG 667.2 ATG main effort is the landing of ground forces on the
   Panayan NE coast, closer to Roxas.
3. Phase 2 - Neutralise. During this phase the main effort of the intelligence
   operations shifts to supporting the execution of TG 667.2 offensive ground
   operations. As NTMEF ground forces are defeated in Panay, the main effort
   will shift from direct action against the NTMEF to operations against
   indigenous hostile forces inside Panay. Despite the main effort shift to
   supporting indigenous forces, intelligence support will still likely be
   required to support TG 667.2 and BX Defense Forces as they hold territory
   regained from the invading NTMEF. Intelligence support to targeting, I&W,
   ISR, and OE refinement will continue throughout this phase as well.
4. Phase 3 - Transition. During this phase, the main effort conducts continuing
   ISR operations in order to monitor the situation and identify threats towards
   a safe and secure environment.

(3) Intelligence Tasks.

```
(a) Common Tasks to TG 667.2 Intelligence Cells.
```

1. Allocate resources and funding to support intelligence operations specified
   in the base plan.
2. Monitor I&W for threats to Coalition partners and partner interests.
3. Develop and refine ISR and I&W process to support mission requirements by
   phase.

**UNCLASSIFIED**

4. Support Advise and Assist (AA), Build Partner Capacity (BPC), Key Leader
   Engagements (KLEs), Humanitarian Assistance (HA), and Force Protection as
   necessary by phase.
5. Assist the development of TG 667.2 organic intelligence capabilities by
   phase.
6. Provide reach-back capability to deployed forces, as necessary.
7. Produce and disseminate intelligence summaries, Battle Damage Reports, ISR
   Collection Plan, and ad hoc intelligence products.
8. Shape allocation and apportionment of theater collection assets to support
   collection priorities and Campaign Plan objectives.
9. Establish the necessary intelligence architecture to support the TG 667.2
   CONOPS.
10. Provide and receive Coalition partner liaisons to and from the TG.
11. Enable intelligence training that supports regional partners’ actions
    against enemy threats to include Advise and Assist (AA), Build Partner
    Capacity (BPC), and engagement (OAAs) missions.
12. Identify shortfalls to improve existing intelligence organisations,
    architecture and procedures to optimise collaboration and synchronise
    orientation, collection, rapid fusion, and timely dissemination of
    intelligence.
13. Submit and process intelligence requirements throughout the implementation
    of this plan for intelligence needs and support to planning.
14. Task and synchronise ISR collection assets to satisfy Priority Intelligence
    Requirements (PIRs).
15. Identify and recommend opportunities for Coalition intelligence exchanges
    and training to further develop and refine regional partner forces, as
    needed.
16. Support kinetic and non-kinetic targeting operations during appropriate
    phases of this plan.

and incentives to support and cooperate with TG 667.2 activities?
(l) What are the intentions of NTMEF with respect to their posturing and potential
employment of chemical /biological weapons and the associated impact on TG
667.2 operations?
(m) What are the intentions of NTMEF and leadership with respect to own
assembly/use of chemical/biological weapons?
(5) Intelligence Activities.
(a) Collection Management (CM). Collection activities will focus on the PIRs and
emerging intelligence gaps and will be conducted and deconflicted in accordance
with established national policies and procedures, and subsequently published CJTF
guidance. Each respective Coalition member will determine an appropriate level of
support for its respective theatre collection assets. Wherever possible, Coalition
intelligence will participate in collection management working group forums in
order to synchronise Coalition and ISR operations.
(b) Analysis and Production (A&P). Coalition intelligence will analyse, produce, and
provide current intelligence and assessments in support of PIRs and provide
collateral releasable products to other partners as required.
(c) Dissemination and Information Sharing. The Coalition will seek to allow greater
sharing of intelligence on a more regular basis; however, disclosure decisions must
be in accordance with each partner nation’s policies. Safeguarding of information
remains a responsibility of each Coalition member in order to prevent unauthorised
release.

### NTMEF Assessment

**NTMEF**

- C2 based on JTF construct – unified

command chain

- Well trained and equipped compared to the

rest of the TPA

- Main platforms are 5-20 years old
- Service in the NT Marine Division is seen as

prestigious and sought after

- Expect Officer Cadre to be well trained and

motivated

- NTMEF capabilities are comparable to

ADF

### Non-State Actors (Insurgents)

**Visayan Peoples Front (VSF)**

- Insurgent organisation based in Belesia

(approx. 300 active members)

- Committed to the establishment of an

independent entity composed of the islands

of Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol from the

Belesian Federation

- Predominantly a Christian organisation

seeking to create a Christian nation

- Has been active in aiding NTMEF in Panay to

achieve political goals

- Prominently aided the NTMEF in securing the San Rafael Mine
- Likely to actively oppose CF in region

### Non-State Actors (Insurgents)

**Free Sulu Movement (FSM)**

- Conglomeration of anti-federation and

independence factions on the Belesian

archipelago (approx. 200 active members)

- The group seeks to break free from the

alleged over reach of Belesian central

government

- Predominantly a secular organisation
- Has links to criminal organisations and will

commit criminal acts to support political

goals

- Is not know to be actively supporting the

NTMEF in either Panay or Palawan

- May oppose CF in region if CJTF mission

does not support political goals

### Non-State Actors (Criminal)

**Black Societies**

- Criminal networks based in Olvana but operating

```
across the Belesian archipelago (approx. 250
active members)

with each family staying local to avoid conflict
with other groups
```

- This criminal network is involved in:
  - Armed Robbery
  - Racketeering
  - Smuggling
  - Narcotics Trafficking
  - Prostitution
  - Gambling
  - Contract Killings
- Will not likely be a threat to CF but may leverage

off CF presence in Belesia

950 active members)

- Operates across the region (even within Nth

Torbia)

Assessed Enemy Critical Factors / Decisive Points

**Critical Factors**

- North Torbia will have long supply lines that cannot overfly South Torbian
  territory
  - This has necessitated the capture of a staging base in Palawan
  - Supply lines will have to traverse through international waters in the South
    China Sea and Sulu Sea
- NT JTF(Div) Command will be located in Palawan
  - Sizeable force will be located in Palawan to protect this vital logistic
    node (4thMarine Bde)
- The long supply lines from North Torbia to Panay means that enemy lines of
  communication are

vulnerable to interdiction and disruption

- North Torbia is relying on local Panayan support to maintain legitimacy of
  invasion
  - North Torbia will foment Panayan dissatisfaction with Belesian Federation
    and spur independence movement

**Decisive Points**

- Reinforce the ground forces in Panay with an additional NTMEF Div troops
- Potential capture of Mt CoolonAPOD/SPOD
- Set conditions for favourable political solution
- Set conditions for the independence of Panay (under North Torbian / Olvanan
  auspices) from Belesian

Federation by exploiting historical ethnic tensions

Assessed Enemy Centre of Gravity

**Strategic**

- North Torbia’s Strategic CoG is the moral narrative that their occupation of
  Belesian territory is to protect ethnic

Torbians from persecution in Belesiaand their ability to control and maintain
that narrative

**Operational**

- North Torbia’s ability to sustain projected power in the region
- Ability to control the sea/air lanes
- The physical manifestation of this CoG are:
  - Surface and sub-surface naval capability
  - Combat aircraft operating out of Palawan and Panay
  - Logistics node at Palawan

**Tactical**

- The APOD/SPODs at Townsville and Greenvale

### CONOPS OUTLINE – OP CERIUM STEAL

### COMD 1 Div (TG667.2) Intent

- **Commander’s Intent**
  - **Purpose.** Defeat NTMEF land forces on PANAY.
  - **Method.** Operation CERIUM STEAL will be a three-phase operation nested
    within Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS). Phase 1 will consist of an amphibious
    lodgement of the TG onto Panay. Phase 2 will result in the Neutralisation of
    the NTMEF by dislocating and then defeating them in battle. During Phase 2,
    X BDE will ADV N and defeat NTMEF forces locN of Passi. This will dislocate
    the NTMEF forces IVO Roxas City and set the conditions for Y BDE to defeat
    these forces in detail. Phase 3 will be the transition of authority back to
    the BX government. At all times, we must be cognisant that the main effort
    is the removal of NT forces in BX. If this can be achieved during any of the
    stages without further bloodshed, then all effort must be taken to explore
    those options.
  - **Endstate.** The liberation of PANAY and removal of North Torbian forces
    from PANAY, establishment of a safe and secure environment in the occupied
    Belesian territories, and conditions set for the UN supervised transition of
    authority in Panay back to the Belesian Government

### Critical Assumptions

- Critical Assumptions
  - ADF Armoured vehicles have overmatch against most NTMEF armoured vehicles
  - Armoured vehicles restricted to roads without significant engineering effort
  - Full SOFA and cooperation with Belesia to allow staging of Coalition Forces
    (CF)

from Belesian territory

- TG667.2 will have operational control of Belesian Forces within PANAY
- TG667.2 will not be permitted to kinetically target the San Rafael mine
  complex
- NTMEF will anticipate and oppose landing
- Air superiority achieved for certain periods over PANAY by coalition forces

Assessed Enemy Critical Factors / Decisive Points

**Critical Factors**

- NTMEF Forces in Panay will be dependant on log node on Palawan
  - Supply lines will have to traverse through international waters in the South
    China Sea and Sulu Sea
  - Main Log hub will be in Roxas– at least a BN will be used to hold this log
    node (Port/Airfield)
  - Alternate Log hub has been identified at Greenvale – estimate a Coy strength
    holding this node
- 3 MAR BDE HQ (NTMEF) will be located in Roxas
  - Affiliate with VPF
- 3 MAR BDE likely to use tank BN as reserve to defeat AS lodgement
  - Reinforced with Company of T-72B/Type 98 tanks
- North To r b i a is relying on local Panayansupport to maintain legitimacy of
  invasion
  - North Torbiawill foment Panayandissatisfaction with BelesianFederation and
    spur independence movement

**Decisive Points**

- Reinforce the ground forces in Panay with an additional NTMEF assets (AD, Cbt
  Engr, EW, MLRS)

```

2. MISSION. To provide coordinated joint fires in support of TG 667.2 IOT CLEAR
   NT Mar DTG on PANAY.
3. EXECUTION.

```
a. The Targeting Process. The targeting process:
(1) does not apply when exercising self-defence governed by the
appropriate principles and ROE;
(2) does not apply immediate action is required;
(3) these situations are not to be used to avoid the targeting process when
of offensive action can be foreseen; and
(4) all targeting and application of joint FIRES are to be conducted in
compliance with the ROE implemented and the Laws of Armed
Conflict (LOAC).

(2) COL Effects
(3) INT;
(4) OPS;
(5) LEGAL;
(6) LO 12 (BX) Moto Bde; and
(7) JFECC secretariat.
c. Legitimate Targets. The principle of distinction as described in International
Humanitarian Law (IHL) will always be applied by commanders.
Commanders at all levels must distinguish the civilian population and objects,
and combatants and military objectives.
d. Legitimate targets are divided into two categories:
(1) Persons as military objectives; and
(2) Objects as military objectives.
```

```
e. The Doubt Rule. If doubt exists about the person or object, they shall be
considered civilian.
f. Dynamic Targeting. The Dynamic Targeting process is applied to:
(1) targets of opportunity; and
(2) planned targets that have changed and require rapid engagement.
COMD TG 667.2 has pre-approved engagement of the following
targets in the AO:
(a) IDF systems;
(b) GBAD systems;
(c) Tank units;
(d) AT units; and
(e) C2 vehicles.

**HOST NATION SUPPORT (HNS)**

References: A. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Belesia/Australia 11 April 2006

1. SITUATION. The Belesian (BX) Government has limited resources available to
   support CJTF 667 efforts to end North Torbian aggression on Panay. As a
   relatively new democratic federation, the Belesian Government is busy with
   maintaining law and order among its other provinces. To that end, Belesian
   resources will be limited to humanitarian aid and other essential resources
   for the effective governance of Panay during and post conflict. The Belesian
   Federation Defense Force (BFDF) has provided support to the liberation of
   Panay in the form of a Motorised Brigade (12 Mot Bde). Logistic support for
   the 12 Mot Bde will be through the BFDF, coordinated and augmented by TG
   667.2 whilst the 12 Mot Bde remains in the TG 667.2 AO.
2. MISSION. Coordinate the provision of HNS to TG 667.2 elements located in
   Panay to contribute to mission success.
3. EXECUTION

```
a. Scheme of HNS. Resources are constrained within BX. To that end it is the intent
of Comd TG 667.2 that forces operating within the TG 667.2 Area of Operations
(AO) shall be self-sufficient and will not impose a significant support bill on the
host nation (HN). In order to reduce demands on HN, all HNS requests shall be
made through the Force Support Group (FSG).
b. HNS Considerations.
(1) Facilities. HN has agreed that TG 667.2 will have access to buildings
within the Iloilo APOD and SPOD where they are available. Requests are
to be made through FSG.
(2) Ammunition and Weapons. TG 667.2 FE will not utilise BX ammunition
and weapons, except those under OPCON with the 12 Mot Bde.
(3) Communications. Belesian telephone (cell and land-line) networks are
relatively advanced and provide a high degree of functionality for military
communications as does the national data network. TG 667.2 may utilise
some of the existing communications infrastructure on Panay, but only at
the OFFICIAL level. Consideration must be taken that civilian
NGO/OGAs will be relying on existing telecommunications infrastructure
on Panay. TG 667.2 will minimise use of the limited telecommunications
infrastructure where possible
(4) Finance. The government of BX has agreed that there will be no charge
for the use of government and military facilities for TG 667.2. Local
contractors which can be provided (permissive environment permitting)
will be charged at the same rate as the local government for the same
service.
```

(5) Fuel. Fuel shall be drawn from Belesian sources only in emergency
circumstances. Where it is necessary to draw from Belsian sources, fuel will be
replaced in kind as soon as practical.

(6) Local Labour. Local labour is available to support TG 667.2 operations.
Payment for labour shall be at agreed rates identified in the technical
arrangement to the SOFA (Ref A, Annex 1, Section 6). All requests for local
labour are to be made through the FSG.

(7) Maintenance. TG 667.2 units shall have access to maintenance facilities and
equipment not in use by Belesian government agencies or military. Access will be
strictly controlled through advance requests to the FSG.

(8) Medical. TG 667.2 units and personnel shall only use Belesian medical
facilities in an emergency to save life and limb. TG 667.2 will utlise organic
CJTF 667 medical services in line with the Health Support Order Annex. This
includes the 12 Mot Bde whilst it is within the TG 667.2 AO. Injured TG 667.2
members shall subsequently be transferred to the Role 2E or 3 hospital as soon
as practical. Any emergency treatment by Belesian medical services shall
immediately be reported to TG 667.2 J07.

(9) Movement/Transport Support. There is limited transport available within
Panay and TG 667.2 formations cannot rely on transportation support from local
contractors within Panay whilst it remains a non-permissive environment. During
Ph3 (Transition), we can expect more transportation support to become available
as government and private industry return. Additionally, any riverine/littoral
services within and around Panay cannot be counted upon to be available until
hostilities cease. 35 Water Transport Sqn will provide riverine transportation
where needed, in addition to organic engineer assets from the CERs and 6 ESR.
Several large water obstacles within Panay may have operating ferries. Planning
for their usage must assume that these services will not be available due to
enemy action.

(10) Rations. TG 667.2 will draw upon organic ration supplies (CL I stores).
Fresh rations will be procured through the FSG and purchased at market rates if
available within Belesia. If fresh rations are available within Panay, careful
consideration must be given that these supplies do not affect availability to
the local population or NGO/OGAs providing humanitarian aid.

(11) Supplies and Equipment. All spare parts and equipment will be provided
through extant supply chains back to the National Support Base (NSB). Troop
Contributing Nations (TCN) will be responsible for providing their own spare
parts and equipment. If available, common spare parts and equipment (e.g. tools)
may be purchased through Belesian stocks by the FSG, but only in accordance with
arrangements in the SOFA (Ref A).

(12) Translation. Translation and interpreter services are available within BX.
Payment for translation and interpreter services shall be at agreed rates

```
identified in the technical arrangement to the SOFAs (as contractors or
local labour). Requests for translation and interpreter services are to be
made through the FSG.
(13) Water. TG 667.2 formations and units are to draw water exclusively from
military sources. Units responsible for acquiring and treating bulk water
may draw water from Belesian military and government facilities although
potability will still need to be confirmed.
c. Tasks to Subordinate Units.
(1) Force Support Group.
(a) Coordinate requests for local labour services;
(b) Coordinate requests for translation and interpreter services;
(c) Coordinate contracting for commercial transport services; and
(d) Coordinate requests for use of Belesian military facilities and
locations in Panay.
```

4. SERVICE SUPPORT. No change to base order.
5. COMMAND AND SIGNAL. No change to base order.

Operating Instrs dated May 2020

**SITUATION**

**1. General**. Information Operations (IO) is the integration, synchronisation
and coordination of two or more non-kinetic means through a number of
Information Related Capabilities (IRC) that generate and sustain a targeted
information advantage. An information advantage is a favourable information
situation relative to a group, organisation or adversary. IO includes both
influencing the decision-making of actors while protecting our own information
and decision-making. These include:

a. Shaping and Influencing (S&I) (at the strategic level);

b. Information Operations (IO) (at the operational level); and

c. Inform and Influence Actions (IIA) (at the tactical level).

2. The IRCs are the tools, capabilities or processes, which can have effects of
   a physical, functional, temporal or psychological nature upon target systems
   and/or target audiences (an individual group selected for an effect). The
   IRCs have many extended sub elements to them but all work towards the same
   aim as the main component under the direction of IO. All actions are
   integrated into the overall campaign plan and are applicable from Phase 1 to
   Phase 3 of OP CERIUM STEAL and must be planned accordingly and not added
   later. Achievement of Australia’s national aims and national strategic
   objectives, as stated in Ref A, within the South Pacific region requires TG
   667.2 IO assets to nest within the CJTF 667 ability to synchronise and
   integrate the Info Ops BOS activities with CJTF 667 Manoeuvre BOS and
   Offensive Support BOS activities. This Info Ops Annex provides the
   non-kinetic guidance for TG 667.2 IO efforts IAW Refs B and C. **3. Adversary
   Forces**. For analysis of operational environment, threat forces and
   assessment of likely en ops, see OPORD Annex B, Intelligence. In summary, Nth
   Torbian (NT) forces have invaded Panay in a bid to seize control of critical
   natural resources under the guise of protecting the Torbian diaspora in
   Panay. NT government (GoNT) and military (North Torbian Marine Expeditionary
   Force – NTMEF) forces are heavily engaged in air, land and sea operations and
   shaping and influencing effects across the northern most island province of
   Panay, in an undermining attempt to separate it from its

nation state of Belesia. This has necessitated the United Nations assembly to
pronounce a Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 8873, noted as Ref D, to
re-establish the Government of Belesian (GoB) sovereignty in both islands of
Panay and Palawan. However, NTMEF information operations activities have been
undertaken for some time and have had the desired effect on the population and
will take some determination to change. This is especially true given NTMEF IO
elements have an additional IRC in their organisation and which has been
actively deployed. That of terrorism. This non-kinetic IRC has the capability of
producing both lethal and non-lethal effects and is very successful.

**4. Friendly Forces**. For information and organisations of detailed friendly
forces, groupings, tasks and capabilities, see OPORD Annex C, Operations. Those
friendly force IRC planners, staff and elements to be made available to TG 667.2
IO Cell, include but are not limited to, those below noted;

a. Civil Military Operations (CMO) elements and components including the
provisions and coordination of tactical CIMIC Team, Civil Aid Programs (CAP),
and Civil Military Actions or Activities (CMA).

Officer function as prescribed in the C2 BOS.

o. Other related staff and organisations as detailed by the Comd to achieve a
desired effect on a target using the means at their disposal. These include
resources inside and outside of the AO.

**MISSION**

5. Information Operations are to be conducted in support of the TG 667.2 mission
   of conducting military operations to expel all NTMEF from Panay, in order to
   create conditions for the re-establishment of a safe and secure environment
   in Belesia and the surrounding region in accordance with the provisions of
   the UNSCR 8873.

**EXECUTION**

6. **Commanders Intent.**

a. **Purpose**. The purpose of TG 667.2 IO within Panay is to DEGRADE adversary
information and information systems whilst protecting and enhancing TG 667.2
information and information systems.

b**. Method**. IO will support the TG 667.2 mission in accordance with the IRC
taskings as noted in Ref E, through performance of the following inform and
influence actions:

```
(1) PROTECT TG 667.2 legitimacy, information and information systems IOT
ENABLE TG 667.2 operations.
```

```
(2) INFORM Panay civil population of NTMEF subversion/atrocities IOT
UNDERMINE NTMEF actions and narrative.
```

```
(3) DEGRADE enemy forces and belligerent actors within Panay IOT
ENHANCE GoB and Panayan authorities.
```

```
(4) INFLUENCE Panay civil population to reconcile IOT ASSIST GoB to re-
establish law and order.
```

c. **End state.** All foreign actors have been rejected by Panayan CIVPOP,
belligerent groups degraded to ineffectiveness, community groups commencing
reconciliation, GoB endorsed and supported as legitimate authority and TG 667.2
preparing to conduct transition actions.

7. **Concept of Operations.**

a. **Essential Effects.** The desired TG 667.2 essential effects are as follows:

```
(1) 1. PROMOTE GoB and TG 667.2 legitimacy. The immediate acquisition of
the dominant narrative within Panay is essential to achieving specified
national strategic aims. IOT facilitate the below listed joint essential effects,
TG 667.2 and GoB legitimacy are a crucial platform that will both prevent
further NT involvement and undermine NTMEF shaping and influencing
actions.
```

```
(2) 2. ISOLATE Panay from foreign influence. IOT allow Panay to return to
normal patterns of life, external destabilising influences that are affecting the
internal security of Panay must be isolated. If belligerent groups within Panay
are unable to communicate and resupply, their influence on the battle space
will be dramatically reduced.
```

```
(3) 3. DEGRADE belligerent actors within Panay. Once belligerent groups are
isolated from supply and support, these groups must be systematically
degraded to reduce their impact on TG 667.2 and GoB operations. This will
be achieved through synchronisation of direct and indirect kinetic and non-
kinetic TG 667.2 actions to dislocate and neutralise belligerent actors in
Panay.
```

```
(4) 4. ASSIST GoB to re-establish law and order. The degradation of
belligerent groups alone will not be sufficient to allow transition of Panay to
HN control. The enhancement of local security forces and government
authorities will be essential to the achievement of the TG 667.2 end state.
```

b. **Joint Effects Tasks (JETs).** In line with the joint essential effects
listed above, the approved JETs are as follows:

```
(1) 1.1 PROMOTE TG 667.2 legitimacy. Throughout this operation, it is
essential that TG 667.2 legitimacy is maintained both IOT maintain public
support in Panay and AS, and to counter pro-NT narratives that seek to
undermine TG 667.2 presence.
```

(2) **1.2 ENHANCE GoB legitimacy.** IOT achieve the end state it is essential
that both the Panay CIVPOP and the international community accept the reinstated
GoB. Therefore, TG 667.2 under CJTF 667 is to facilitate every opportunity to
enhance the GoB’s reputation to further counter the NT negative narrative.

(3) **1.3 UNDERMINE NT legitimacy.** IOT prevent NT force projection and
escalation, it is essential that the NT narrative is dismantled at every
opportunity using facts and examples of NTMEF influence within Panay. This will
undermine NT’s political standing in the region and reduce their impact on
shaping regional and global opinion.

(4) **1.4 EXPOSE NTMEF atrocities and regional shaping actions.** Linkages to
activities within the NTMEF shaping and influencing activities will further
degrade NT’s political position and enhance the TG 667.2 narrative.

(5). **2.1 DISLOCATE NTMEF within Panay.** Where possible, TG 667.2 seeks to
physically and functionally dislocate NTMEF forces through non-kinetic actions
and non-lethal effects IOT activate NTMEF withdrawal triggers and avoid kinetic
engagement with TG 667.2 elements.

(6) **2.2 ISOLATE NTMEF, Insurgents and Auxiliaries from support bases.**
Concurrent isolation of belligerent groups within Panay from local, regional and
transnational support will deny these groups the ability to remain below the
detection threshold and enable TG 667.2 targeting.

(7) **3.1 EXPOSE NTMEF destabilising actions.** IOT influence Panayan CIVPOP to
expose belligerent groups concealed within their midst, links to NTMEF shaping
and influencing within Panay are an important platform for the dismantling of
belligerent group support.

(8) **3.2 INFORM Panayan CIVPOP of atrocities.** Continual exposure of
belligerent group activities against the Panayan CIVPOP and GoB will contribute
to the isolation of subversive elements from the population.

(9) **3.3 ISOLATE NTMEF, Insurgents and Auxiliaries from Panayan CIVPOP.** In
addition to INFORM effects, TG 667.2 must undertake non- kinetic actions to
cause these groups to isolate themselves from the population IOT allow
targeting.

(10) **3.4 SHAPE NTMEF, Insurgents and Auxiliaries into TG 667.2 EAs.** Once
clearly isolated from Panayan CIVPOP, TG 667.2 needs to shape these groups into
a time and place of its own choosing IOT neutralise them.

(11) **4.1 ENHANCE Panayan authorities.** IOT ensure that Panayan establishments
have the capabilities required to assume control of Panay, TG 667.2 must
progressively enhance host nation authorities in preparation for transition.

```
(12) 4.2 ENHANCE ethnic relations. A significant factor of instability within
Panay is the state of relations between the various ethnic groups. By
improving these relations at the local level, TG 667.2 will reduce a significant
threat to Panayan authority’s ability to maintain control of the population.
```

```
(13) 4.3 PROTECT vulnerable populations within Panay. In concert with
international conventions, treaties and obligations, TG 667.2 must understand
its responsibilities with regard to UNSCR1325, 1612, 1674, 1820 and 2242 in
addition to the culture and values beliefs within Panayan society.
```

```
(14) 4.4 PROTECT critical infrastructure within Panay. The legitimacy of
both TG 667.2 and GoB in Panay will rest on TG 667.2’s ability to maintain
essential services, utilities and amenities to maintain or return to normal
patterns of life. TG 667.2 must ensure these services are not targeted,
collaterally protected and maintained where possible throughout this
operation. That which is not, must be repaired or replaced as soon as
practically possible and implement minimum military involvement in
maintaining function.
```

c. **Approved Target Audiences (TA).** As advised in the Target Directive, Ref
B, the approved TG 667.2 TAs are as follows:

```
(1) TA 1: Government of Belesia (GoB) - Panay. This TA includes all
members of local and regional government in all capacities within Panay. The
GoB is deemed critical to the success of OP CERIUM STEAL as it is the
basis for the implementation of UNSCR 8873 and provides TG 667.2 its
legitimacy and authority.
```

```
(2) TA 2: Panay Civilian Population (CIVPOP). This includes all ethnic
groups collectively IOT build understanding, unity and social cohesion. This
TA will be essential to the success of OP CERIUM STEAL as it is that, they
who must ultimately endorse the GoB and TG 667.2 and comply with
Panayan authorities whilst denying foreign and belligerent actor influence
within the community.
```

```
(3) TA 4: Panay local Authorities. This includes all law enforcement (police),
emergency services (fire, rescue, and ambulance), security organisations
(customs, sheriff, and bailiff) and regulatory arms of government that
regulate, oversee, enforce and maintain rule of law within Panay. A holistic,
WoG approach to the reformation and enhancement of Panay institutions is
deemed critical to the strengthening of the government and the long term
restoration of law and order.
```

```
(6) TA 5: NT CIVPOP. This TA is restricted to those groups within NT IOT
influence support to the NT Government. The degree of public support for
NT’s political position will directly influence the likelihood of military
incursion or further NTMEF employment. This TA will mainly be the
responsibility of CJTF 667, but TG667.2 will enable these efforts.
```

```
(7) TA 6: International Civilian Population (INTNPOP). This TA is restricted
to those groups external to the Belesian Islands IOT influence support to the
NT Government. The degree of public awareness of NT and NTMEF’s
shaping and influencing actions within the region will directly influence
perceptions of TG 667.2 legitimacy, regional diplomacy and lobbying of the
UN, placing increased political pressure on both NTMEF and NT.
```

```
(8) TA 7: NTMEF. This includes enlisted ranks through to senior command
levels. The NTMEF poses a significant threat and is likely to deliberately seek
opportunities to escalate its involvement in Panay based on TG 667.2
activities. TG 667.2 must not present opportunities for NTMEF to dominate
the narrative by claiming that TG 667.2 is manoeuvring aggressively, must try
to influence peaceful NTMEF withdrawal from the disputed region and if
unsuccessful must convince the NTMEF that it cannot win any military
contest on either practical or moral grounds. This is to be further developed
into a surrender strategy during the combat ops phase.
```

```
(9) TA 8: Insurgents. This includes members through to senior leader levels.
The Insurgents are predominantly from the Visayan People’s Front and are
being used by the NTMEF as a force to divide the community, incite violence
and promote propaganda as a platform/screen for subsequent NTMEF and
NTMEF SF activities. The chaos and optics that the Insurgents provide
NTMEF are essential to NTMEF’s ability to retain the initiative and maintain
the dominant narrative within Panay, therefore the degradation and
dismantling of the Insurgency will present a significant operational and
messaging victory for TG 667.2.
```

```
(10) TA 9: NT Auxiliaries. This includes interested parties through to organisers
and instigators. The Auxiliaries include privately funded security firms (such
as the Wagner Group) used to provide security to the San Rafael Mine. The
debunking of Auxiliary propaganda and countering of violence and
influencing actions is crucial to establishing a safe political environment for
Panay to work towards the desired end state.
```

d. **Approved Operational Themes.** The approved TG 667.2 themes are as follows:

```
(1) TG 667.2 667 is here at the invitation of the GoB to enforce UNSCR 8873
and to protect the Panayan people.
```

```
(2) The current destabilised situation in Panay is the result of NT intervention and
NTMEF influences assisted by local radicals.
```

```
(3) Panay’s future rests on dialogue, not violence. All aspects of the Panayan
community are encouraged to leave the past behind and move towards a
brighter future together.
```

```
(4) TG 667.2 looks forward to working with the GoB (in Panay) and the Panayan
people to restore Panay to prosperity and success.
```

e. **Key Messages.** The key messages aligned with the approved TG 667.2 themes
are as follows:

```
(1) TG 667.2 is here to help. Please work with coalition forces to allow them to
assist the Panayan local government.
```

```
(2) If you see something, say something; report any suspicious activity to local
authorities. Do not take action yourself.
```

```
(3) Violence is being used to drive Panayans apart; talking between community
groups is the key to the future.
```

```
(4) TG 667.2 looks forward to working with the government and the community
to return life in Panay to normal.
```

```
(5) Do not take up arms or support those that do. Law and order will be restored
and criminal acts will be punished under law.
```

8. **Groupings and Tasks.**

a. **CMO.** TG 667.2 will be supported by CMO from the tactical level to plan
and conduct PROMOTE, ENHANCE, INFORM and INFLUENCE actions in support of the
force. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 1.

b. **PSYOPS.** Tactical PSYOPS Teams (TPT) will be held at the operational level
for distribution to tactical formations at the direction of the commander.
Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 2.

c. **EW.** Electromagnetic and directed energy will be used to SCREEN, DENY,
DISRUPT, INTERDICT and DEGRADE adversary communications and emissions across the
EM spectrum. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 3.

d. **KLE.** Key WoG representatives from DFAT, AFP, OGA and Defence will foster
strategic outcomes through engagement with the relevant Panayan stakeholders.
Additional guidance and engagement instrument of authority is contained within
Appendix 4.

e. **MPA.** PAOs and detachments will operate from HQ TG 667.2 and formation HQs
across Panay under guidance from CJTF 667. Additional guidance is contained
within Appendix 5.

f. **CNO.** May be proliferated at the operational and strategic level to
attack, defend and exploit information and data networks from the National
Support base within Australia and New Zealand. At the TG 667.2 level, these
effects may be requested and coordinated at the tactical level, but HQJOC will
maintain OPCON of these capabilities. Additional guidance is contained within
Appendix 6.

g. **DECEP.** Deception activities will be coordinated at the tactical level by
HQ TG 667.2 supported by elements of CJTF 667 and JOC within Australia.
Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 7.

h. **OPSEC.** All formations and units are responsible for the maintenance of
OPSEC. Specific guidance is contained within Appendix 8.

i. **PPP.** Force postures will be dictated by the developing situation on the
ground tempered by the achievement of national strategic aims when security
permits. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 9.

j. **PS.** Force Protection Elements (FPE) will be allocated to key strategic
points of entry (SPOE) within Panay, whilst Reserve components will provide
tactical commanders an organic protective security asset for use within tactical
AOs. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 10.

k. **Information Assurance (IA** ). IA activities will be coordinated at the
operational level by HQ CJTF 667 supported by elements of the National Support
base within Australia. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 11.

l. **Offensive Support (OS) / Destruction**. Elements of conventional naval, air
and land manoeuvre will be combined with Special Operations Task Group (SOTG)
assets to facilitate strategic destruction effects. Additional guidance is
contained within Appendix 12.

m. **Evidentiary Imagery (EI).** All images captured that are of an operational
nature should be forwarded to MPA through respective formation Chains of
Command, and opportunities to leverage the dominant narrative should be
exploited. Additional guidance is contained within Appendix 13.

9. **Coordinating Instructions**

a. It is incumbent on the Tactical Headquarters to ensure adequate control and
support/taskings are organised for the IRCs. The coordination of which begins
with the IRC’s elements meeting in their respective working group and discuss
the issues and progression of their task and effect deliver on their assigned
targets. These targets being assigned from the Joint Prioritised Integrated
Target List as (JPITL) maintained by the Joint Fires and Effects Coordination
Centre (JFECC). The results of which and suggestions for future targets/effects
will be then brought forward by their applicable operations staff to the
Information Operations Work Group (IOWG). The SO2 IO will then collate the
Measures of Performance (MOP) and the Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) and
synchronise them at the Joint Effects Working Group (JEWG). At the JEWG, staffed
by the SO2 Joint Effects will be the SO2 Joint Fires, intelligence rep, legal
rep, targeting officer and other staff involved in the targeting process. After
the discussions and proposals are advised, these will be brought to the Joint
Effects Target Board (JETB) where the Comd or his delegate will approve the
actions, apportion resources and if required, task elements via Fragmentary or
Task Order (FRAGO for assigned FE or TASKORD for resources not found on the
ORBAT) to achieve effects. The times and frequency of these meetings and work
groups will be advise by way of a HQ Battle Rhythm (B2C2WG).

b. IRCs are expected to conduct their own work groups and have a trained staff
member provide inputs and exchange information coherently as the IRCs Subject
Matter

Expert (SME). The SME may be required to attend at the JEWG or to the COMD’s
JETB but should not attend as a regular matter of course. Where an order is to
be struck for an action or activity, the SME can assist in drafting the order
and give advance warning of the order to their respective IRC elements.

c. In some cases where the sensitivity of the desired effect or the secrecy
surrounding the chosen target exists, the IRC tactical element may not
necessarily be inform of the higher order impact or the true target for the
desired effect. IRCs are expected to conduct their activities with a minimum of
information and should report all aspects of their task using the communications
chain in accordance with command and signals reporting requirements. Timings are
TBA.

d. MOPs and MOEs assist in the accomplishment of the assessment process by
qualifying or quantifying the intangible attributes of the information
environment. The MOP for any one action should be whether or not the TA was
exposed to the IO action or activity. MOEs should be observable, to aid with
collection; quantifiable, to increase objectivity; precise to ensure accuracy;
and correlated with the progress of the operation to attain timeliness.
Indicators are crucial because they aid the joint IO plan in informing MOEs and
should be identifiable and reported on by all IRCs. Information of effects and
measures can be found in Ref E.

**ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS**

10. **Log Arrangements and Resupply**

a. The prudent and general log rule for all IRC tactical teams and elements is
self-sufficiency. When employed in the AO, all IRC elements with teams or staffs
must have their own logistics and transportation resources and be capable of
sustained ops for periods from 72 hrs to 7 days without the need for resupply.
If resupply is required then the parent unit of the IRC team is to make the
necessary arrangements. Contingency plans for emergencies such as break down,
veh recovery or comms failures must be detailed in a units patrol TTPs and
orders.

b. All IRCs with actual tactical elements, will retain responsibility for the
provision of daily sustainment or for organising that resupply with a unit with
control of the AO where the team operates. Where the element is allocated to a
formation HQs for a task, then it is to come under administrative control of the
HQs support unit. Where an element is in location of a forward combat unit then
administrative arrangements may be made with that unit for sustainment. Care
must be used when assigning command and control arrangements while elements are
in a units location or under their responsibility for security. It is expected
that elements may have to provide assistance to a supporting unit and it may
even be necessary for them to be incorporated into the watch routine and
perimeter security plan.

c. The IO staff in the HQs are to become the technical administrative leader for
IRC staff or cells as maybe assigned to the HQs. As such, the IO staff cell of
that HQ are expected to have an administrative officer / NCO capable of sorting
the working and living arrangements of these members whilst attached to the HQs.
These staff should come as self-contained as possible but there is an
expectation that their pers welfare and basic office needs will be meet by the
staff in IO to ensure maximum efficiency of their

staff function. However, as the SME for their IRC, the HQs will have an
expectation that special to needs items such as laptops and software or systems
access will be brought with the SME or sorted out with that staff member prior
to assignment.

11. **Tpt Arrangements and Movements.**

a. IRC tactical elements and teams are also expected to come with their own
intrinsic transportation to move them into and around the assigned AO. Where
this transport is not compatible with the organisation assigned or doesn’t meet
the protection or mobility needs of the team, then arrangements detailing the
transportation requirements are to be created and tasked to the forward unit.
This may also include the assignment of security to the team as well. The IRC
teams will be expected to organise vehicle resupply and light recovery and
should a vehicle require replacement, that IRCs unit remains responsible.

b. Staff assigned as SME to a HQs are to be carried and transported by the HQs
in its vehicles and transport means when the HQ moves. Should a SME arrive with
intrinsic transportation, arrangements should immediately be made for that
vehicles resupply and recovery arrangements. The HQs has responsibility for the
veh but should not expect to have control or use of that resource unless
arrangements can be mutually organised and agreed to.

12. **Admin Support Arrangements**.

a. As for the logistical arrangements, tactical teams remain the responsibility
of their higher IRC organisation for admin support. The exception being health
care. Should a tac team member become a casualty, especially in the forward
area, then they are to enter the chain of evacuation by the best means possible
with consideration given towards their condition and severity.

b. Staff attached to the HQs will be treated as for the arrangements of the
permanent HQs staff.

ANNEX XX TO
TG 667.2 OPORD
DATED XXXXXX
FORCE PROTECTION
```

**Reference** :

A. ADDP 3.22 Force Protection 2015

B. CJTF 667 OPORD 01 OP STEEL SENTINEL

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order** : Zulu

**1. Situation**.

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of TG 667.2 OPORD 01 and Annex B
(Intelligence).

```
(1) Force Protection (FP). Force protection is defined as preventive measures taken to
mitigate hostile actions against ADF personnel, resources, facilities, and critical
information (see Ref A). FP measures may be defensive (active and passive), offensive
and recuperative measures.
```

b. Protection Principles. The following principles of protection provide
military professionals with a context for implementing protection efforts,
developing schemes of protection, and allocating resources:

```
(1) Command Responsibility. FP is a function of command. Commanders at all levels are
responsible and accountable for the protection of their assets. Subordinate commanders
may use their discretion in imposing additional FP measures, but may not reduce the
measures imposed by this HQ without prior approval.
(2) Risk Management. Risk Management is the coordinated activities to direct and control
the Joint Force with regards to risk. Risk management ensures that risk is managed
effectively, efficiently and coherently across the Joint Force.
(3) Coordination. FP must be fully coordinated across all components, multi-agency and
multinational elements. It is essential to coordinate FP planning at the strategic,
operational and tactical levels in order to ensure a unified approach and mitigate
vulnerabilities that might otherwise be exploited by a threat.
(4) Integrated. FP is integrated with other activities, systems, efforts, and capabilities
associated with unified joint operations to provide strength and structure to the overall
effort. Integration must occur vertically and horizontally with coalition partners
throughout the operations process.
(5) Economy. Excessive allocation of resources for FP may remove capabilities needed to
accomplish the mission. Economical use of FP capabilities allows the commander to
focus resources on the protection of those assets that are deemed critical to operational
effectiveness and mission success.
(6) Prioritisation. There will always be insufficient resources to protect every asset against
every threat all of the time. Priority should be given to centres of gravity, both tangible
and intangible.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(7) Flexibility. FP policies and measures must have the flexibility and agility to respond to
rapidly changing threats, within resource limitations.
(8) Layered. FP capabilities are arranged using a layered approach to provide strength and
depth. Layering reduces the destructive effect of a threat or hazard through the
dispersion of energy or the culmination of the force.
(9) Redundant. Protection efforts are often redundant anywhere that a vulnerability or a
critical point of failure is identified. Redundancy ensures that specific activities,
systems, efforts, and capabilities that are critical for the success of the overall protection
effort have a secondary or auxiliary effort of equal or greater capability.
(10) Enduring. Protection capabilities are ongoing activities for maintaining the objectives of
preserving combat power, populations, partners, essential equipment, resources, and
critical infrastructure in every phase of an operation.
```

Threat and Risk Assessment.

```
(11) Conventional threats. For more detail see Annex B. The North Torbian Marine
Expeditionary Forces (NTMEF) essentially represent a “near peer” threat with a wide
range of capabilities. As they have demonstrated, they have sufficient force capabilities
to seize and control key infrastructure and large areas of terrain in a littoral
environment. They also possess the necessary capabilities to project and sustain power
beyond their national boundaries. Whilst the Torbian People’s Army (TPA) is known to
hold quantities of CBRN capabilities, it is highly unlikely they will utilise these
weapons during this conflict.
(12) Unconventional Threats.
(a) Visayan Peoples Front (VPF) Insurgents. The VPF is an armed insurgent group
committed to establishing an independent entity composed of the islands of
Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol. Over time, the group, which originally sought
the creation of a separate secular state, demanded the exclusion of Muslims and
creation of a Christian nation. The VPF has aided the NTMEF in securing key
infrastructure and installations during the early stages of NT occupation of Panay.
Levels of cooperation between the NTMEF and the VPF at this time is unknown.
(b) Free Sulu Movement (FSM) Separatists. The FSM is a conglomeration of anti-
federation factions of the Belesian archipelago. The group seeks to break free of
the alleged overreach of the Belesian central government and abuses of the
Belesian Federation National Guard. The FSM is not known to be actively
supporting the NTMEF in Panay.
(c) Black Societies Criminal Network. The Black Societies Criminal Network is
based mainly in Olvana with networks and interests in Belesia and surrounding
nations. This criminal network is involved in armed robbery, racketeering,
smuggling, narcotics trafficking, prostitution, gambling, and contract killings. The
Black Societies will not involve themselves directly in the current conflict but
may capitalise on demand through black market operations. Post conflict, these
criminal elements will take advantage of any power vacuums to establish greater
influence, particularly in areas will no to little law enforcement.
```

```
(d) Tantoco Cartel Criminal Organisation. Originating in South Torbia (RT), the
Tantoco Cartel operates across the region with networks and interests in Olvana
and Belesia. Like the Black Society, the Tantoco Cartel is involved in all forms of
illegal activities. Recent expansion into Belesia and Olvana has resulted in turf
disputes with the Black Society. Again, like the Black Society Criminal Networks,
expect that the Tantoco Cartel will establish in areas where law enforcement is at
a minimum, particularly in a post-conflict environment.
```

(13) Non-Military Threats. For environmental health threats, see the Health
Support Annex.

```
(a) Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) / Contaminated Grounds. BX holds large
amounts of toxic industrial chemicals for multiple purposes, including mining,
production of electronic goods, water purification, wastewater management,
pesticides and fertiliser to increase agricultural output. A mine collapse in Panay a
few years ago resulted in a release of 20.6 million tons of waste water into a
nearby river. Prior to the capture of the San Rafael Mine Complex, large
quantities (5000lt+) of reagents were kept at a storage facility near the mine
complex. These reagents include Sulfuric and Hydrochloric Acids, chemicals
which in their storage state presents hazardous chemicals. Large quantities of
Hydrochloric acid can also be distilled to produce Chlorine gas, that can be
crudely weaponised. In most instances, a level of MOPP will need to be taken
when operating near large TIC storage facilities.
(b) Battlefield Pollutants. Aside from UXOs (detailed below), battlefield pollutants
from destroyed vehicles and equipment will pose a hazard to TG667.2 forces.
NTMEF armoured vehicles are not know to utilise depleted Uranium (either as
part of composite armour or as a projectile) or other radioactive material.
However, commanders at all levels must be cognisant of these threats.
(c) Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). It is expected that UXOs will litter the battlefield.
UXOs from dropped ordnance (from aircraft, missiles and artillery) can be
encountered when manoeuvering around previously held enemy defensive
positions. All identified UXO are to be treated under SOPs relating to EOD
disposal.
(d) Pollution. BX faces significant pollution problems stemming from poor industrial
practices. High levels of air pollution require mitigating measures to ensure TG
667.2 members health and safety.
(e) Potable Water. The majority of the BX archipelago’s urban population has access
to potable water. In rural areas people must rely on local sources such as rivers,
streams and wells to obtain water for cooking, drinking and washing. Currently,
about 90% of all Belesians can access potable water. All water sources are
considered potentially contaminated and not potable until tested.
(f) Sewage. Seventy-five percent of the population has access to improved sanitation,
predominantly in the developed urban areas. Even in the cities, this does not
always equate to fixing plumbing in residences, but also includes improved
latrines. The lack of universal or adequate sanitation contributes to the high rate of
infectious disease spread, especially in the dense urban environments.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(g) Disease. The following diseases are known to be present in BX:
```

1. Diarrheal diseases;
2. Hepatitis A;
3. Malaria;
4. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;
5. Leptospirosis;
6. Schistosomiasis;
7. Hepatitis;
8. Tuberculosis; and
9. Q Fever. **2. Mission**. TG 667.2 will protect the force and conserves combat
   power against threats and risks associated with the conduct of operations
   throughout Operation CERIUM STEAL. **3. Execution**.

a. General. FP must be included in all parts of planning down to the lowest
levels. Commanders will conduct appropriate risk management procedures to ensure
that all risk to maintaining force preservation is considered. Reduction in
operational capability due to avoidable identified threats is unacceptable.

Risk. The FP posture should be based on risk management, not risk elimination.
Deliberate or accidental casualties are a reality of military operations, as are
material and equipment losses and an overemphasis in avoiding them may impact
adversely on the achievement of the mission. Commanders therefore must balance
risk within the context of mission accomplishment. Component commanders should
establish FP awareness within their staffs and provide suitable advice and
direction to subordinate units. FP functions will be fully integrated and
coordinated in the operational planning process from the outset.

b. Tasks Throughout. Formation Commands conduct FP operations to protect the
force and conserve combat power in AO FANNING. Large troop concentrations and
sustainment facilities shall be protected from NT missile/CBRN attacks by
establishing an Integrated Air Defense System. Vulnerability assessments are to
be conducted for staging areas, C2 nodes, and MSRs / ASRs concerning threats
from CBRN, IEDs, missile attacks and other indirect fires as well as direct
attack throughout this operation. Operational threats from enemy UAVs/UASs must
be determined and mitigated. We must take clear measures and undertake effective
coordination to ensure inter-operability between TG 667.2 and BX Defense Forces
under OPCON. The implementation of successful FP measures will be particularly
important for safeguarding the TG 667.2 Center of Gravity (our long range strike
capability). Supporting tasks of the FP warfighting function include:

```
(1) Conduct operational area security.
(2) Employ safety techniques (including fratricide avoidance).
(3) Implement OPSEC.
(4) Provide intelligence support to protection.
(5) Implement physical security procedures.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
(6) Apply anti-terrorism (AT) measures.
(7) Conduct law and order.
(8) Conduct survivability operations.
(9) Provide force health protection.
(10) Conduct chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) operations.
(11) Provide explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and protection support.
(12) Coordinate air and missile defense.
(13) Conduct personnel recovery.
(14) Conduct internment and resettlement.
```

c. Protection by Phase of OP CERIUM STEAL.

```
(1) Phase 1 - Lodgement. This phase will see the lodgement of ground forces in Panay as
the main effort. Amphibious landings will be conducted on Panay along with landings at
an established APOD/SPOD. TG 667.2 FP will focus on maintaining safe operations of
the disembarkation of forces through the APOD/SPOD. Protection to be enhanced by
OPSEC, and measures to eliminate fratricide during forward passage of lines with BX
forces already on Panay.
(2) Phase 2 - Neutralise. This phase will see decisive land operations take place on Panay.
The aim of this phase is to defeat the NTMEF on Panay. Protection to be enhanced by
control of all sea and air lanes around Panay and consideration for CBRN threats to be
factored into daily MOPP states.
(3) Phase 3 – Transition. This phase will see the transition of authority on Panay from TG
667.2 to either a UN sanctioned Peacekeeping Force or a follow on HN force. It will be
expected that TG 667.2 FE will remain to conduct Stability Operations until a
replacement force can take over. Protection measures will begin to put greater emphasis
on non-conventional threats, law and order, health, crime, drugs, safety, protection of
captured enemy personnel, operational area security, physical security, antiterrorism and
on coordination of FP measures with Host Nation. The potential for kidnapping or
capture of friendly forces increases significantly in this phase requiring the
establishment of a Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC). Key risks to TG 667.2
forces throughout this phase include accidents caused by fatigue or failure to adhere to
published SOPs and standards. The BX government assumes responsibility for their
own security and infrastructure maintenance.
```

d. Coordinating Instructions.

```
(1) Training. Personnel and units are to receive appropriate FP training, particularly in
Escalation of Force procedures, ROE and battlefield / environmental hazards.
(2) Vulnerability Assessments (VA). In order to ensure that FP measures meet required
standards, site assessments must be conducted for any semi-permanent sites (FOBs,
main camps, etc.). The assessments routinely involve sites visits with interviews with
key specialists and inspection of all FP related procedures and infrastructure, ranging
from defensive positions through classified document handling procedures to food
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
hygiene. The process is intended to be consultative and can be used by site commanders
to reinforce their cases for improvements to their FP posture.
(3) Force Protection Working Groups. Force Protection Working Groups will be
established at HQ TG 667.2 and at subordinate Formation Commands.
```

**4. Sustainment**. See Logistic Support Order Annex to TG 667.2 OPORD 01. **5.
Command and Signal**.

a. Command. FP measures issued by COMD TG 667.2 are valid for all Coalition
members and facilities in AO FANNING.

b. Reporting. Deviations from the prescribed FP measures, changes in threat, and
FP incidents are to be reported via the TG 667.2 reporting chain. CBRN incidents
are to be reported to COMD TG 667.2 via the TG 667.2 CBRN Warning and Reporting
chain.

ANNEX XX TO
TG 667.2 OPORD
DATED XXXXXX
```

**MILITARY PUBLIC AFFAIRS**

**Reference:** ADFP 3.13.2 Military Public Affairs 14 Feb 2020

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: Zulu.**

1. **Situation**

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of TG 667.2 OPORD 01, Annex B
(Intelligence), and Annex XX (Civil-Military Operations).

b. General. The Public Affairs (PA) office is assigned as a Command Advisory
Group section (G09) to TG 667.2. PA provides timely and accurate information in
support of the Commander’s objectives for strategic communication. PA informs,
educates and counters misinformation with respect to key audiences (both
civilian and military) regarding TG 667.2 objectives, accomplishments and
challenges. By engaging local and international media, as well as through social
media, PA is able to disseminate key themes and messages to a wide audience to
engender and maintain support for TG 667.2 and to correct misinformation in the
public domain. Via spoken and written word, and through still and video images,
PA represents a trusted and powerful tool to reach diverse audiences. Robust and
effective PA activities are fundamental to TG 667.2’s ability to proactively
communicate to audiences in a truthful and timely manner. PA aims to be ‘first
with the truth,’ providing the facts regarding ongoing events and military and
humanitarian activities, and by assisting the media in reporting accurately by
providing context. It also informs public perception and opinion by providing
reliable, timely and accurate information to local and international media,
while monitoring media outlets to ensure that information is disseminated. Media
monitoring collects reports from all open sources to disseminate a complete
picture of media coverage and to assist Key Leader Engagement in decision-making
and ensure consistency with other PA organisations throughout the Area of
Operations (AO). All units and elements of TG 667.2 as well as Host Nations’
armed forces and IO and NGOs are primary sources regarding security-related and
humanitarian issues. This annex provides policy guidance and tasking concerning
the public affairs coverage of TG 667.2 operations. It includes coordinating
instructions for releasing information and visual products, news coverage, media
support and, support of the internal information and outreach engagement
programs.

c. Communication in the Information Environment.

```
(1) Host Nation. Belesia’s state-run and public media compete with private and opposition
publications and broadcasters. Internet, television and mobile phone networks are more
accessible to much of the population in the AO, notably in urban areas. TV is the most-
popular medium. In more isolated rural areas and islands, traditional communication
print and media remain the most influential communication tools. Belesian government
bodies are in the lead for shaping and influencing their publics’ opinions regarding
progress made in re-establishing regional development and security. TG 667.2 will
deliver support and assistance in this area to local authorities. TG 667.2 PA effort is
aimed at attaining and maintaining popular support for the mission at the higher level by
```

```
explaining the goals and legitimacy of the UN-sanctioned IBSAF mission and of TG
667.2’s intentions, actions and achievements as well as by developing a media
campaign based on success stories that appeal to the public.
(2) International Media. All personnel must understand the power of the international media
and the importance it plays in maintaining support for ongoing operations. The
international media, to include traditional journalists, documentarians and reputable
bloggers, will significantly influence western public and political opinion. The
international media is strongly augmented by local stringers, who will accompany the
other local media representatives at media functions. These stringers will feed the
international media from Coalition events as well as from adversary spokespersons.
(3) North Torbia. Transparency in political and social debate is subject to extremely tight
governmental control in Nth Torbia, resulting in the populace being extremely hard to
influence from external government and organisation. The Nth Torbian government
continues to use a wide range of media as an integral part of its activities to influence
the populace and international actors. Nth Torbia and its affiliated partners and proxies
will attempt to shape the information environment based on their interests.
```

d. Core Audiences.

```
(1) Troop Contributing Nations (TCN) members, countries and regional policymakers,
opinion leaders, publics, service members, and families.
(2) Regional, national, and international News Media Representatives (NMRs).
(3) Belesian and Nth Torbian public.
(4) TG 667.2 TCN service members and civilian staff.
(5) Host Nations Defence Forces.
(6) International Organisations (IO) and NGOs.
```

e. Assumptions.

```
(1) The Nth Torbian government and the Nth Torbian Armed Forces can be expected to
mount a massive, carefully constructed, well-orchestrated, worldwide propaganda
campaign as part of its military campaign.
(2) Nth Torbia will use political, economic, cultural, and military issues and events as
opportunities to discredit Coalition resolve, military capability and intentions in the free
press. Nth Torbia will use the media to further its propaganda goal to weaken public
support and confidence in Coalition military resolve and/or intentions.
(3) Non-state organisations and proxies associated with Nth Torbia can be expected to use
the media to further their goals.
```

2. **Mission**. TG 667.2 plans and executes active communications and military
   public affairs activities in support of Operation CERIUM STEAL (as part of
   Operation STEEL SENTINEL) to provide responsive, timely, and accurate
   information about TG 667.2 activities to both domestic and foreign audiences,
   and to counter enemy misinformation to support the goals and objectives of
   the Commander.

3. **Execution.**

a. Concept of Operations. PA policy is maximum disclosure with minimum delay,
but consistent with operational security and Privacy Act provisions. PA will
assist in the creation of conditions that maintain Coalition integrity and the
confidence of TCNs as well as the International Community in TG 667.2 operations
by:

```
(1) Providing timely information and news products that demonstrate the core messages;
(2) Providing timely information about TG 667.2 operations to public and news media
representatives and facilitate news media operations;
(3) Providing internal command information programs and products to keep units and
family members informed;
(4) Countering effects of Nth Torbian propaganda attempts through an active PA posture by
informing and educating external and internal publics of the actual situation and facts;
(5) Conducting media embed program consistent with AS and/or TCN media embed
directives;
(6) Facilitating outreach engagement initiatives to inform and educate local, national and
international opinion leaders, academics, and defence-issues analysts; and
(7) Maintaining and managing TG 667.2 social media.
```

b. PA Effects.

```
(1) TG 667.2 is recognised as a stabilising force by national and international audiences.
(2) TCNs and public audiences receive timely updates of TG 667.2 mission progress and
significant events to include enemy and friendly casualty status without compromising
operational security.
(3) International recognition and support for the IBSAF Coalition is strong and unwavering.
(4) Nth Torbian propaganda is effectively countered by increased accurate and independent
reporting from international, national, and local news agencies.
(5) International public understands that Nth Torbian people are not the targets of TG 667.2
military efforts.
(6) TG 667.2 forces and TCNs are informed of mission progress and critical issues of force
protection and safety and efforts to sustain health, welfare, and morale.
(7) Increased reporting of defeats suffered by Nth Torbian military forces by international,
national, and local media.
(8) Key audiences recognise TG 667.2 will transition authority to follow-on forces or Host
Nations for stability or peace support operations on Panay once security conditions
permit.
```

c. TG 667.2 PA Tasks.

```
(1) Coordinate across the TG 667.2 staff sections and Formation Commands to synchronize
communications efforts.
(2) Provide PA guidance to Formation Commands.
(3) Prepare for media coverage throughout all phases of the operation, including social
media coverage and support to outreach engagement initiatives.

(10) Support internal communications efforts to reach and inform internal audiences and
protect them from enemy misinformation and propaganda.
```

d. PA Support to Inform and Influence Activities.

```
(1) Coordinate daily messages and talking points consistent with strategic objectives.
(2) Coordinate efforts to counter Nth Torbian propaganda by having international news
media presence in critical locations to accurately report events.
(3) Coordinate to ensure PA activities do not compromise or conflict with TG 667.2
Information Operations.
(4) Coordinate and focus media attention on operational and strategic isolation of Nth
Torbian regime, destruction of NTMEF military capability in Panay, and TG 667.2
humanitarian assistance efforts.
```

e. Coordinating Instructions to Formation Command and Subordinate Units PAOs.

```
(1) All Formation Commands will submit daily Public Affairs Situation Reports
(PASITREP) to TG 667.2 PAO. TG 667.2 PAO will consolidate all reports.
(2) Keep TG 667.2 Public Affairs Officer (PAO) informed of any critical information
requirements such as media requests, military and civilian casualties, large-
scale/significant incidents, injuries to PAO personnel or NMRs.
(3) Lead, plan, coordinate, and conduct operational and tactical PA activities within their
TAORs.
(4) Obtain still and video imagery of events/activities and send to TG 667.2 PAO for
approval and release.
(5) Safeguard classified information and imagery by retaining the release authority at the
military public affairs office.
```

(6) Key Leader Engagements (KLE) are critical to the success of all PA
operations. They should be used as frequently and in as many situations and
mediums as possible.

(7) Provide military public affairs support to the TG 667.2 command to highlight
the successes of the operation to Target Audiences through internal and external
media coverage, KLE, and visual imagery.

(8) Keep TG 667.2 military personnel and family members informed; provide the
local and International audiences truthful information through News and TCN
Department of Defence Media Representatives.

(9) Support higher level PA plans to counter misinformation, gain, and maintain
the support of the Local and International Communities and deter further Nth
Torbian aggression.

(10) Be prepared to receive media embeds and provide support to media during the
operation.

(11) Designate Unit Public Affairs Representatives (UPAR) for each Bn sized
element. UPARs are responsible for briefing commanders on current Public Affairs
Guidance (PAG) and ensuring PAG is disseminated and units are prepared to
facilitate media engagements. All appropriate military personnel should be
provided with Talking Points prior to media engagements to help facilitate
communication synchronisation and ensure they understand the overarching intent
on the mission.

(12) Ensure that subordinate commanders and PA personnel are familiar with
communications, transportation and other media support requirements; approved
PAG and ground rules concerning this operation.

(13) Do not interfere with News Media Representatives (NMR) as long as they do
not interfere with the execution of the mission or threaten to violate OPSEC.

(14) Advise TG 667.2 PAO immediately of news media exposure to classified
information or any possible media ground rules violations.

(15) TG 667.2 personnel are not authorised to confiscate media cameras, film,
audio/videotape, or reporter’s notebooks. Any questions regarding the specific
application of this policy should be referred to the TG 667.2 PAO.

(16) All entitled media are to have approved credentials before joining any unit
with TG 667.2 PAO task organisation. Lists of accredited and registered media
will be provided to the Formation Command and subordinate PAOs on a daily basis.

(17) Provide TG 667.2 PAO with a press kit for their Formation or unit, to
include a formation/unit fact sheet and Commander’s biography with photo.

(18) Utilise best practices in media interviews when talking to reporters.

(19) Following official announcement of deployment, units may acknowledge they
have been notified for a deployment; however, they may not release specific
details that may violate OPSEC. Commanders are encouraged to release information
if appropriate and PAOs should be prepared to address media requests in support
of family readiness efforts.

(20) In the event of a large scale incident, critical information leak,
capture/kill of a key leader, or mass casualty situation which may require
communications consequence management, all key information (5W’s) must be
forwarded immediately to TG 667.2 PAO.

(21) In the event of a crisis, the TG 667.2 PAO will coordinate with higher
headquarters to determine release authority and appropriate public statements to
make.

(22) Requests for public affairs information (RFIs). Submit all RFIs to TG
667.2.

(23) Support for News Media Representatives.

```
(a) Media Escort.
```

1. Accreditation. Requirements for accreditation will be established by the
   Coalition/national-level defence agencies and supported by TG 667.2 PAO
   through the CJTF 667 J09. As a minimum, the CJTF 667 J09 will institute
   procedures to determine the legitimacy of individuals as _bona fide_ media
   representatives entitled to receive support afforded by TCN and TG 667.2
   forces. News media representatives must have passports and working visas
   identifying them as journalists to fulfil CJTF 667 accreditation
   requirements.
2. Assignment. TG 667.2 G09, in consultation with subordinate unit PAOs, will
   determine the assignment of NMR to specific subordinate units within the AO
   to preclude overloading any single unit. Where possible, media
   representatives will be assigned to their preferred location.
3. Facilities. TG 667.2 units will provide media embeds with adequate
   accommodation, meals, and transportation. A degree of discomfort will be
   expected by embeds and will not be treated any better than their host unit
   personnel.
4. Inoculations. NMR accompanying TG 667.2 in the field will be required to have
   the same inoculations, at their own expense, administered to military
   personnel participating in the operations.
5. Communications. TG 667.2 and major subordinate commands will provide
   communications services free of charge to civilian media representatives when
   commercial facilities are not available. Transmission by military
   communication facilities will be on a non-interference basis. News media will
   be advised of the status of their traffic.
6. Transportation. TG 667.2 will provide accredited media representatives with
   military transportation into and within the AO when such travel is in
   connection with assignments to cover the operation and when commercial
   transportation is restricted into the area or unavailable.

```
(b) Security. The presence of news media representatives in operational areas will
require the following considerations concerning security:
```

1. Procedures will be implemented to preclude the unauthorised release of
   classified or sensitive information. NMRs violating embargo agreements will
   be immediately dis-embedded.
2. Media representatives can access operations, intelligence, and other
   classified areas only in case of strong need and under strict escort and
   control.
3. Individuals are not authorised to release information to media nor are they
   permitted to agree to a personal interview without prior coordination with
   the PAO supporting that unit or command. When the PAO has coordinated the
   media visit, personnel may grant media requests for interviews and provide
   only unclassified information in interviews, briefings, and written
   materials. Do not make “off the record” statements to media representatives.
   (c) Audio-Visual. TG 667.2 will assist the media as necessary in obtaining
   audio- visual coverage. (d) Embedded media will abide by established ground
   rules on releasable and non- releasable information.
4. **Sustainment.**

```
a. Administration. Media are required to carry their own equipment.
b. Logistics.
(1) Non-embedded media (Unilateral) covering our operations should be “self-
sustaining”. TG 667.2 PAO will coordinate additional logistical support to media as
required. Intent is to maximize use of Host Nation Support (HNS). Host Nation
Contract Support is used if support/service is not available through military logistic
means or through HNS.
(2) Media embeds will have their own protective equipment. Military embeds will be
provided with military transportation (ground or air) into and within the AO while
covering the operation.
(3) Embedded NMRs will be entitled to medical care provided to TG 667.2 personnel
in the event of life threatening injuries.
```

5. **Command and Signal.**

a. Media will use commercial means of communications if available. If commercial
lines are not available, official military means will be authorised. Military
satellite transmission facilities can be provided when operationally feasible.

b. Media may use independent satellite uplinks for transmission of products from
field locations when the on- scene commander determines transmission will not
violate OPSEC or compromise an ongoing operation.

c. TG 667.2 PAO co-locates with TG 667.2 HQ.

E. UNHC – P Report 008/XX – Humanitarian Sit Panay Isles dated XX XXX XX

**OVERVIEW**

1. **General.** This annex details the Civil Military Operations (CMO)
   objectives and activities to be undertaken in support of the land component
   operations. This is to support the establishment of security and stability
   conditions in the JFAO sufficient for the transition of responsibility for
   security to a mandated UN Follow on Force (FoF) and subsequent Host Nation
   Military / Security forces. This annex is to be used by those elements
   involved in Civ- Mil activities and those whom may need to understand the
   Civ-Mil environment for their own BOS. All CMO intentions will be undertaken
   with in IO objectives and in line with the COMD’s intent (here with
   restated);

a. **Purpose**. Enforce UNSCR 8873 to re-establish Belesian sovereignty in Panay
and Palawan.

b. **Method**. Deploy TG 667.2 with enablers from ADF and OGA to the JFAO to
prosecute Multi-Domain Operations against North Torbian elements in Belesian
sovereign territory. Coordinate WOAG and multinational efforts to enforce
UNSCR 8873.

c. **Endstate**. The removal of NTMEF from Belesian sovereign territory,
establishment of a safe and secure environment in the occupied Belesian
territories, and conditions set for the UN supervised transition of authority in
Panay and Palawan back to the Belesian Government.

**SITUATION**

2. **Enemy**. Analysis of operational environment, threat, threat forces and
   assessment of likely En Ops, see Intelligence, OPORD Annex B.
3. **Friendly**. Detailed friendly forces, groupings, tasks and organisation see
   Operations, OPORD Annex C.
4. **Inhabitants**. A detailed social-political and infrastructure summary of
   the JFAO is provided in Ref A to E, and detailed in the enclosed Country
   Study Appendix 1. That study providing the following points as particular
   relevance to the TG 667.2 CMO plan for the Panay Island province of the
   nation state of Belesia:

a. **Population.** The population of Belesia is 109,000,000 based on July 2016
estimates. The pop in Panay is 4,301,000 (2015) which is spread throughout the
island’s urban and rural area with pop centres noted in Panay Map Appendix 2 and
as follows;

```
(1) Roxas; pop 574,000 capital of province of Aclan supporting 17 smaller towns.
```

```
(2) San Rafael; pop 582,000 capital of province of Antiq supporting 18 towns.
```

```
(3) Caticlan; pop 761,000 capital of province of Apiz supporting 16 towns.
```

```
(4) Iloilo City; pop 2,384,000 capital of province of Iloilo supporting 42 towns.
```

b. **Language**. Panay has three official languages, Tok Belesia, Tagalog, and
English, although Tagalog is seldom used by the younger generations. English is
the language of government, education and business. Tok Belesia, a Melanesian
pidgin similar in nature to Papua New Guinea Tok Pisin and Vanuatu Bislama. It
is the lingua franca. There are a number of indigenous languages spoken which
belong to various linguistic groups. The number of speakers of these languages
has steadily dwindled in recent decades. FE should be able to communicate with
the pop in English, especially the younger people without need of translators.

c. **Culture and Society**. Within Panay there are four ethnic groups, Panayan
48%, Torbian 32%, Olvanan 18%, and European 2%. Within each of these groups a
number of clans or extended family groups exist. Each of these clans
historically operated within a defined territory as noted in Panay Map attached
as Appendix 3, moving throughout their home lands. While a homogeneous and
multicultural population, FE should still exercise caution when dealing with
tribal issues as this is still a strong bond within Panay society.

d. **Religion**. The Roman Catholic Church (RCC) is the major religion in Panay,
being a de facto provider of many public services a more functional government
would ordinarily supply. The RCC has strong and deep roots within most
communities both religious and secular, and its international character has led
to some suspicion that factions within the local cathedral communities might be
partisan actors or at least being logistical links for Olvana and Torbia. The
influence the RCC has over the population, almost 65% are active parishioners,
cannot be overstated. A highly religious society means that care must be taken
by the FE to not be seen to be contrary to the church or its symbology.

e. **Politics and Government**. Following the 1967 announcement of the
government to grant Panay self-governance no later than 1972, elections to a
popular assembly were held in

1971. The Panay District Assembly consists of 40 members with 10 members elected
      by each of the 4 districts and is headed by a parliament based out of the
      capital Iloilo City. The government still operates on a small “pay for
      services” scheme to get work done. This is often and incorrectly referred
      to as corruption, but is not. It is the recognised method of getting govt
      work done. This is not to be confused with the graft and payouts done by
      the mining sector of business as this money goes straight to elected
      members and not into the government supply.

f. **Economic outlook.** Successive Panay governments have overseen the
exploitation of the islands natural resources with a light hand, generally
granting concessions, specifically mining, in a resource bidding war that if
successful would see Panay gain high economic benefits. The commercial and
industrial businesses which thrive in Panay have worked out that small wages and
pay offs to politicians can lead to high profit. These commercial interests need
careful handling. The FE can expect that commercial enterprises will be quick to
exploit the situation and it is anticipated that claims and compensation will be
sought as the security circumstances improve.

g. **Electricity.** Panay has a coal fired power generator located on the
outskirts of each of the provincial centres. Power is reasonably well provided
for but suffers from high demand shortages especially during peak periods,
resulting in outages of a few hours. Energy is supplied as 240-250v 60Hz cycle
which is broken into 110-120v in the homes and buildings with power within the
pop. Breakdowns in coal delivery can also disrupt supply sometimes lasting in
outages of days. Critical infrastructure has backup generators but these are
also subject to outage due to disruptions in diesel fuel supply. FE should not
expect to be able to tap into and utilise the civilian electricity grid and must
come self-contained with its own generator power supply and fuel to run it.

h. **Water Supply.** All towns draw their town water from underground aquifers
and the larger rivers which runs through them. The water quality can run from an
A to C rating. Supply during the dry season may also cause shortages. Given the
low quality and lack of quantity, FE must bring its own purification and water
supply systems.

i. **Fuel Supply.** Panay is bisected by the AMADA Natural Gas Pipeline, which
is a significant infrastructure of considerable value to the national Belesian
government. Natural gas is the fuel of choice for the pop needs being used for
everything from cooking to powering vehicles and generators. Fuel supply of both
diesel and petrol is provided from refineries in Belesia which can result in
shortages due to the problems of shipping and distribution. Fuel supplies for FE
will not be possible from inside Panay and CSS & LOG should not plan to get
these from in country with care taken to not cause shortages to the pop.

j. **Waste Treatment**. Regional centres have a rudimentary and inefficient
sewage systems with the more remote areas generally have individual house septic
systems. This has in past caused fouling of the water supply which then causes
health concerns with the pop. The FE needs to be cognisant that its waste
disposal systems and programs do not cause environmental issues nor exacerbate
problems with the existing infrastructure.

k. **Telecommunications**. A high **s** tandard of telephone, mobile phone and
internet connections are available across the whole island, with high speed data
capability available in regional centres. Remote rural areas are for the most
part available with various levels of reliability. It is well known that the
phone infrastructure was built by the MISO Telecom company and that while a
reliable and well used system, can be intercepted and be used as an information
and intelligence source. Phones which use the local system will be subject to
foreign intelligence service information collection activities. It is important
for rebuilding of the country so must be protected from kinetic or non-kinetic
disruption in all phases.

l. **Health.** The island’s civilian health services and support infrastructure,
based on hospitals at the provincial centres. Nationals generally seek treatment
for major medical treatment in Belesia in preference to the Panay health
service. FE should not expect to be able to use the civilian infrastructure and
can expect requests for support when they are located in country.

m. **Legal System.** Justice is administered by the national authority, which
was generally only concerned with serious crimes. Local issues are generally
handled by provincial magistrates or city judges. Given the CJTF will operate
under the provisions of the UNSCR 8873 and an extant SOFA, FE should have very
limited dealings with the Panay legal system.

Legislative issues including the SOFA and ROE are to be found with the Legal
OPORD Annex K.

n. **Policing.** Under national rule, a semi-professional constabulary force of
approximately 100 officers was trained in basic policing skills. Following
self-autonomy, this small department was expanded and now has some 5,000
members. A Police Proficiency and Capability report is expected from the AFP on
the competencies and shortfalls of this law enforcement agency. It is to be
found with the Military Police OPORD Annex AD. The expectation is that the
countries police force will return and provide the necessary law enforcement
activities upon cessation of hostilities.

o. **Transportation.** Panay has a well-developed, albeit not extensive road
system. Road haulage operations are a key component of the success of the Panay
economy. Care must therefore be exercised by FE to ensure damage to the roads by
either offensive support actions (deliberate or dynamic) or ground force usage,
is kept to a minimum. Where damage occurs, it is to be reported immediately and
repaired as soon as practically possible. The low weight rate (40t
classification) of most highways and bridges will see the use of the roads by
the heavy A veh fleet and larger logistics vehicle fleet severely curtailed.

p. **Humanitarian Situation.** United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator – Panay
**(** UNHC-P) reporting at Ref F estimates approximately 40,000 IDP’s are
scattered throughout Panay as a result of increased activities by the enemy who
have a sophisticated public communications and information operation. These are
moved as the camps reach capacity or if the reason for the displacement ceases.
In most cases, the camps successfully re-integrate the IDPs back to their home
locations.

q. **IDP Camps.** The following IDP camps may have been identified in Panay:

```
(1) Municipality of Roxas: Two camps; Tanza Norte to the east & Ilaya adjacent to
Roxas.
```

```
(2) Municipality of Passi; Two camps; Arac and Bacuranan.
```

```
(3) Municipality of Sara. Three camps; Alibayog, Labigan and Salcedo near Sara.
```

```
(4) Municipality of Iloilo: Two camps; Cabatuan and New Lucena.
```

r. **IDP/Refugees Movements.**

```
(1) Population movement internal of a country produces internally displaced persons
(IDP) but if the population flees across countries borders, they become refugees.
Additional IDP/Refugee movement is expected on commencement of Phase 2 and
additional temporary camps are expected to emerge. These movements are
expected to include both those fleeing active conflict and those who have
benefitted from the supported government and now fear reprisals.
```

```
(2) Greater movements of people combined with an expected deterioration of law &
order and the economy during and immediately after decisive operations are likely
to exacerbate existing problems within communities. This is likely to have a
```

```
particular impact on women with increased incidence of rape, transactional sex
and related gender based violence.
```

```
(3) The maintenance of awareness on the situation of Displaced Persons and
Refugees (DPRE) in the AO will remain a CMO responsibility.
```

```
(4) Upon ceasing of hostilities, security of movement is restored and people feel that
there is sufficient law and order to protect them from attack or retaliation in their
home communities, IDP/refugees will begin to return. This is expected to strain
post-conflict housing availability, public services and food/water supplies.
```

5. **HA and Civil Society Organisations (CSO).**

a. Some of the IO/NGO operating across the CJOA and within Belesia are managing
the IDP camps. It is likely that international and other staffs who work for
IO/NGO may depart or curtail their activities during military operations as they
will conduct their own threat assessments and act IAW the UN Security Level
System.

b. Some CSO are anticipated to be in place to support HA distribution. NGO/IO
will likely determine their own security criteria for entry based on information
from their own sources and the United Nations Department of Safety and Security
(UNDSS). Threat elements will likely attempt to disrupt HA supply and
distribution IOT support their own agenda.

c. Those IOs and NGOs are found in the Panay civil organisations and contact
list attached as Appendix 4.

6. **Civil Assumptions.**

a. Heads of various sections, key stakeholders within the Panay government will
also be based at the capital in Iloilo. Further, other coalition stakeholders
within military and government, NGOs, and other stakeholders such as ICRC will
be based in Iloilo during operations.

b. The Panay people in the occupied area have a neutral position yet positive
sentiment towards the CJTF and aligned Panay Govt.

c. Threat groups will leverage off the CivPop to collect on the CJTF/ADF
activities.

d. Provincial political entities are positive towards Panay Govt and CJTF
elements.

e. Law enforcement aligned with provincial govt are also positive towards Panay
Govt and CJTF elements as well.

f. Medical services and public utilities will deteriorate less than 24hrs of the
commencement of combat operations.

g. National economic aspect of country will deteriorate and will heavily rely on
the informal market and local and provincial economies.

h. Liaison authority to engage with for HN government ministers resides with
CJOPS.

i. IO/NGO will be capable of provision of HA and initial capacity building.

**MISSION**

7. **Purpose**. CMO activities will support the TG 667.2 Mission in order to set
   the conditions for transition of authority to the mandated UN Follow on Force
   (FoF) supported by the international community and to minimise the impact of
   TG 667.2 operations on the civil population.
8. **Method**. CMO will support the TG 667.2 mission by:

a. Undertaking direct comms and liaison, collaboration and interagency planning,
actions and activities with the WOG to set the conditions for transition to the
mandated UN FoF.

b. Supporting the IO objectives, assist in the delivery of key messages to the
local population which prepares them for the return and establishment of the
legitimate Govt of Belesia with an emphasis on our intention to achieve
transition to the UN or Host Nation FoF.

c. Conduct or coordinate those targeted CMO activities on the assigned persons
or groups to achieve the desired effects and outcomes and control those elements
with the AO who will interface with the population.

d. Ensuring that TG 667.2 operations and offensive actions minimise targeted
activities and collateral damage to key civil infrastructure. Where this has not
been achieved, undertake such assessments and organise the repair or replacement
of this damage in as orderly and responsive way as possible.

e. Ensuring that CJTF operations do not create a dependency by the HN population
on TG 667.2 resources.

f. Ensure the avoidance of placing additional strain upon the already fragile
key civil infrastructure including assisting those FE responsible for assisting
the HN Govt departments becoming re-established to provide a return to
normality.

g. The provision of appropriately OFFICIAL briefs to key stakeholders.

h. Assist with the provision of a secure environment that allows IO/NGO to
deliver services and possible HA to the populace.

i. Coordinating with key agencies regarding IDP/Refugee movement through the AO
so agencies are able to establish interim IDP camps if required.

j. Facilitating the provision of Immediate Life Sustaining Aid (ILSA) through
coordination with the On-Site Operational Coordination Centre (OSOCC), Other
Governmental Agencies (OGA), International Organisations (IO) and NGOs.

9. **Endstate.** Set the conditions for the transition of responsibility to the
   mandated UN or HN FoF.

**EXECUTION**

10. **Concept of Operations**.

a. **CMO Elements**. To conduct CMO the following units and force elements will
be utilised for the delivery of effects and provision of Civ-Mil influencing and
informing activities as assigned and directed by the Joint Effects Targeting
Board. The lack of coalition forces, specifically US Mil, means that Civil
Affairs (CA) teams are unavailable for tasking or use.

```
(1) The lack of CA means that the principal CMO tool will be the tactical CIMIC
detachments and teams as provided from the formation CIMIC Group. These
elements will be the priority task for assessments coordination of CMO effects as
tasked to units and FE. It is expected that each Cbt Bde will be provided with its
own CIMIC Tactical Support Teams (TST). The role of CIMIC is to support the
mission through three core functions:
```

```
(a) enhance situational understanding of the civil space
```

```
(b) support/enhance decision-making, and
```

```
(c) conduct tactical CIMIC tasks as detailed from OPORD.
```

```
(2) Civ Mil Activities (CMA), any unit / sub-unit, elements or staff can be utilised for
activities and duties as tasked through ops as detailed in TASKORDs from HQs.
This is inclusive of any specialist elements as attached to the formations.
```

```
(3) Civ Mil Liaison (CML) staff for communication and coordination between HQs
and those OGA or HN departments. All staff are BPT to be detached as required
within the TG 667.2 C2.These would be coordinated through the Info Ops KLE
cell staff (G2) assisted by the CIMIC Teams.
```

```
(4) Engineer Assessment Teams for reconnaissance and assessment of infrastructure
and civilian capabilities. May also be required for Engineer Civil Assistance
Program (ENGCAP) activities in later phases.
```

```
(5) Medical Assessment Teams for assessment and inspection of medical facilities
and population health services. May also be required for Medical Civil Assistance
Program (MEDCAP) activities in later phases.
```

```
(6) Military Police detachment Engagement Teams for investigations and assessment
of detainee handling infrastructure and civilian capabilities. May also be required
for Police Civil Assistance Program (POLCAP) activities in later phases. It will
be expected that a separate and comprehensive hand over of security
arrangements will be specified.
```

```
(7) Female Engagement Teams (FET) or Cultural Support Teams (CST) for
engagement and assessment of the civil situation and population support either
from specialised formed teams or those created for the operation. These teams are
```

```
not to be used in the HUMINT role and if they are, must not be additionally
tasked for Civ Mil activities or actions.
```

(8) Other IO Information Related Capabilities (IRC) units or elements which may
be tasked or accompany the CMO elements as part of an IRC combined effects team.
These may include but are not limited to;

```
(a) The Key Leader Engagement (KLE) cell will have a close relationship with
the CMO elements as they will coordinate much of the interactions between
any FE and those civilian leaders and persons of influence.
```

```
(b) Psychological Operations (PSYOP) teams may also be with CMO elements
to either distribute or provide for delivery that IO product and messages for
the same audience that Civ Mil activities apply to. CMO elements may also
be tasked to distribute this product as they meet with the civilian agencies
and individuals allocated to so engage.
```

```
(c) Ligh t Electronic Warfare Teams (LEWT) may accompany CMO elements
as a means of gaining movement within the AO. They may also be there to
provide early warning in the event of hostile activities against FE.
```

```
(d) Public Affairs (PA) officers or teams may also accompany or request
information for input into their products and stories in spt of the FE IO
campaign. They may include Combat Camera members or staff or they may
request imagery as part of CMO activities.
```

```
(e) Those staff which exist in or on the formation HQs which can facilitate civil
engagement either through personal contacts (such as family, educational or
business etc ties), secular contacts, medicinal contacts or any interest
contacts that may provide meeting opportunity.
```

(9) The Dept of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has a special relationship with
defence. It may provide a liaison offr, a Policy Advisor (POLAD) to the higher
headquarters who advises the COMD on strategic issues such as diplomatic
negotiations, demarche exchanges, adherence to agreements such as the Montreaux
document or Ottawa agreement and national policy interpretation. They cannot
provide operational or tactical direction nor should they interpose in the
manoeuvre of combat forces.

(10) Interactions with other Civil Agencies. These are defined as those
non-military organisations which will exist in the battle space and may be made
up on International Organisations (IOs) such as the UN, ICRC, Amnesty
International etc, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) such as WADE, RAID, FADE,
MWC, LoRD etc., and Other Government Agencies (OGA) such as AFP, DSTO, ABF etc.
It is a misconception that the Military Land Force entrusted with enforcing the
UN mandated actions can also direct or task those civil agencies which are or
may soon be present in the AO. The military should never task nor expect that
those civ agencies will do the land forces bidding and can only set the security
conditions, which enables them to do the work that they wish to do. Dialog and
open communications must always be sought but influencing or

```
exploitive actions on behalf of the force is never to be planned. Their neutrality,
impartiality and organisational concern for humanity must always be respected.
```

b. **Scheme of Manoeuvre**. CMO will be conducted across all phases. TG 667.2
CMO elms and those FE tasks with CMO effects will deploy to support TG 667.2
operations during all phases with TG 667.2 conducting a handover of CMO
activities to the mandated UN or HN FoF in Phase 3.

```
(1) PH 0 Shaping. CMO elms conduct initial liaison with key stakeholders, including
HN Govt, OGA and UN OSOCC. These tasks will be conducted under the
guidance and coordination of the CJTF 667 CMO. Conduct mission planning for
the possible assistance in population movements including the returning of
IDP/Refugees. Participate in the refinement of target lists with Joint Effects and
Targeting (JET) and the provision of information for the KLE engagement
strategy. Gain Situational Awareness and Situational Understanding (SASU) of
key civilian and humanitarian issues, threats and opportunities IOT identify
potential CMO activities within the AO.
```

```
(2) PH 1 Lodgement. TG 667.2 G9 will deploy with HQ TG 667.2. G9 will
coordinate initial assistance and response with OGA, OSOCC, IO/NGO.
Allocation of CMO assets throughout the AO is as follows:
```

```
(a) TG 667.2 – G9 CMO Dir (O6) and Staff,
```

```
(b) TG 667.2 – G9 CMO PSO (O5), Staff Brch and 1 x TST (-)
```

```
(c) TG 667.2.1 (X BDE) – 1 x CIMIC TST (26);
```

```
(d) TG 667.2.2 (Y BDE) – 1 x CIMIC TST (26);
```

```
(e) TG 667.2.3 (16 AVN BDE) – 1 x CML Tm (from 667.2 TST).
```

```
(4) PH 2 Neutralise. Refine initial CIMIC assessments and continue Key
Stakeholder Engagement (KSE). Conduct civil engagement with available HN
civil authorities. Facilitate the delivery of key IO messages to local population.
BPT facilitate and control the delivery of ILSA. Coord with OGA, OSOCC, and
IO/NGO for the management of refugees/IDP’s within the AO. In conjunction
with OGA and OSOCC plan and facilitate the restoration of key essential services
within capacity.
```

```
(5) PH 3 Transition and Redeployment. Conduct handover of all TG 667.2 CMO
activities which will be purposely planned and undertaken to NOT build in
dependencies, to other agencies and the mandated UN or HN FoF.
```

12. **Coordinating Instructions.**

a. **Stabilization Aid Funds/Commanders’ Emergency Relief Program (SAF/CERP).**
TG 667.2 currently does not have an allocation of funding to implement Consent
Winning Activities (CWA) and Quick Impact Projects (QIP). A request for funding
has been sent to HQJOC and further details will be released by FRAGO.

b. **Compensation Claims.** All civilian claims for compensation are to be
investigated at the command level prior to submission to the HQ TG 667.2 G06.
Commanders are not authorised to agree to pay compensation claims.

c. **Locally Employed Civilians (LEC).** Opportunities will exist for
contracting LEC to fulfil certain functions in support of TG 667.2 efforts and
base support plans. The employment of LEC is to consider the effect upon the
integrity of local community structures and delivery of essential services.
Formation S9 staff are to ensure coordination with HQ TG 667.2 G9 Main during
LEC employment planning phase. Guidance on payment rates is TBI, but shall
conform within existing SOFA. HQ TG 667.2 G9 approval is required to employ LEC
from: Police, Fire, Ambulance, Border Protection, Education Dept, Water Dept or
Health Dept. This also includes specialists e.g. police/teachers and
administrators.

d. **Operations Assessment (OA).** All CMO reporting including SITREPs, Incident
Reports, CMO SITREPS and Quicklook Storyboards will be utilised in support of
the TG 667.2 OA process.

e. **Request for Assistance (RFA).** The following procedures are to be used for
RFA planning and execution:

```
(1) In the first instance formations are to ensure civilian agencies maximize use of
their resources (either integral or contracted) before accepting RFA for
consideration.
```

```
(2) Formations are authorized to execute RFA as long as they do not prejudice the TG
667.2 mission and can be executed within formation capabilities.
```

```
(3) RFA that require external support are to be passed through TG 667.2 G9 for
assessment, coordination and de-confliction with other civilian agencies and CJTF
resources.
```

f. **Humanitarian Standards for Encampment Site Selection and Operation.** TG
667.2 will not be responsible for establishing IDP or refugee camps.
Responsibility for the establishment of IDP/refugee camps resides with the UN
humanitarian community. However, TG 667.2 may be required to support the
movement and route security if requested by the IO / NGOs through the OSOCC.

g. **CMO Measures of Effect.** There must also be continuous assessment of the
civil dimension in order to determine measures of effectiveness (MOE) and the
progress of the mission. This ongoing assessment task is performed by CIMIC
assessment teams and monitored by the CMO staff. MOE refer to observable,
preferably quantifiable, subjective indicators that an activity is proceeding
along a desired path. A commander uses MOE to determine whether an operation is
succeeding in achieving the goals of the operation according to the mission. MOE
should be developed as a product of mission analysis. MOE will differ for every
mission and for different phases of a mission. As the commander and staff
identify specified, implied, and critical tasks, they should define what
constitutes successful completion of each task. They decide how the MOE will be
identified, reported and validated. They determine what action will be taken
when the MOE is achieved, as well as contingency plans in case MOE are not
achieved according to the original plan. MOE are not necessarily fixed and can
be adjusted as the situation changes. See appendix 7.

h. **CMO Normality Indicators**. Normality Indicators (NI) serve to measure
trends and progress in the recovery of a civil society to an improved quality of
life. NI measure the level of development of the civilian condition to reduce
the level of dependency on the military

force by the civil population and civil authorities. Data should be objective,
quantifiable and collected systematically. The force commander must exploit all
sources of data measuring the quality of life and recovery of the local
population in the AO, as well as the effectiveness of military operations that
assist in this recovery. Direct and indirect MOE and NI should be jointly
developed with civilian agencies to reinforce unity of purpose and effort in
civil– military activities. It is the interface with the civilian sector that
provides the means for collecting data that contributes to normality. NI should
be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, results oriented and time based),
objective and comparable from occasion to occasion. Measuring only that which is
easily measured, will give a false impression. Robust information management
systems are required to support the delivery of worthwhile MOE and NI. See
appendix 8.

**ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS**

13. **Civilian Resource Requirements**. Arrangements will be required to provide
    a minimum of one APOD/SPOD access to the AO which must remain serviceable,
    with apron or wharf space, to be provided to IO/NGO for delivery of HA.
    Ideally, this will be a separate facility from the military. It should come
    complete with its own aircraft / vessel handling and refuelling facilities
    as well as transport facilities for loading cargo.
14. **Military Resource Requirements.**

a. **ILSA.** Immediate Life Sustaining Assistance is defined as the provision of
small scale emergency supplies and services which are needed as a matter of
extreme urgency (in- extremis) to save life or to prevent serious suffering. The
provision of ILSA may be conducted without approval from TG 667.2 HQ where it
can be provided within formation resources and or capability. In the main, ILSA
comprises the provision of water and food however, depending on the
circumstances it may also include; shelter, medical assistance (life, limb or
eyesight), transport, rescue and repair of essential infrastructure.

b. ILSA should be provided at ‘arm’s length’ whenever possible with the direct
distribution to beneficiaries undertaken by IO/NGO, HN agencies, CSO, village or
tribal leader. Direct distribution of ILSA by TG 667.2 FE should only be
undertaken in-extremis and as a last resort and may be sourced from TG 667.2
supply chain. ILSA stocks will be made available to TG 667.2 formations from PH
1 for emergency distribution to the population as required. Provision of ILSA
should be in response to immediate and life threatening requirement and should
not displace any current arrangements in place by NGOs. Under no circumstances
should ILSA become the main source of provisioning for the population.

c. **Bottled Water.** Water (bulk or by 5, 10 or 20 litre military jerry can)
**is not** to be provided for from TG 667.2 log stocks. Commercially procured
plastic 5 or 10 litre collapsible water containers in either blue or clear
colour and bottled drinking water may be authorised where thirst may become the
possible cause of death within the population. It will be carried in unit A and
B Ech in sufficient bulk quantities and provided for upon auth from the unit
Comd. Water for bathing/cleaning will **not** be provided.

d. **Foodstuffs.** Military rations / CRP **is not** to be provided for from TG
667.2 log stocks. Limited quantities of HUMRAT prepacked high energy supplements
may be available and are

to be used only as a means of having an immediate relief of starvation. It will
be carried in unit A and B Ech in sufficient bulk quantities and provided for
upon auth from the unit Comd.

e. **Shelter.** Shelter **is not** to be provided for unless it is necessary to
provide an immediate life sustaining assistance. FE tentage or canvas,
especially that which is easily identified as military (coloured green, brown or
camouflaged) must never be used to provide shelter to the population. Where
shelter is required to protect from the elements it must be of a civilian
pattern, coloured blue or white and set up away from any possible military
associated facilities. Blue tarpaulins, poles and cordage will be carried in
formation B Ech in sufficient bulk quantities and provided for upon auth from
the formation Comd.

f. **Medical**. Medical care and use of med supplies is to be strictly limited
and is only to be used in those extreme cases where life, limb or eyesight is in
danger of being lost. The application of med supplies is to be limited to those
members of the FE who are trained and can provide the necessary care and support
given the conditions as found in the AO. Civilians who enter the chain of
evacuation due to FE actions, must be turned over to the civil authority at the
earliest opportunity. The SMO or G07 will provide the necessary decision making
arrangements with the formation Comd.

g. **Transportation**. Pop movement and transportation is **not** to be done
utilising any military vehicle of TG 667.2. Pop movement is to be carried out
with civilian pattern vehs and should be made off of the designated MSR. Should
a requirement exist to provide life sustaining transport then the use of clearly
identified ambulances / medevac ac may be requested. The auth of this will
require Formation Comd approval. Under no circumstances should A vehs or
armoured veh ambulances be used.

h. **Rescue**. Any requirement to facilitate any rescue should only be
undertaken where life is in danger or the pop was forced into a position of
requiring rescue owing to the unintended consequences of FE activities. Rescue
may be required where the pop has, in moving out of the way of FE manoeuvre,
inadvertently become entrapped in the obstacles or minefields of either side.
Such rescue activities will require the unit COMDs approval and may extend to
the use of TG 667.2 resources such as breaching and mine detection eqpt but done
only after the area has been secured and cleared of en threat. The rescue
activities are only to be undertaken after the force has achieved its assignment
and any rescue effort must not impede the military mission.

i. **Maintenance**. Any requirement to complete work on civilian infrastructure
such as; power generators and electricity lines, water pumps, filtration units
and distribution systems, sewage and sanitation works, and medical / education
facilities may only be undertaken if;

```
(1) The damage to these facilities were a result of FE actions or fires,
```

```
(2) The damage is to public facilities and not private or commercial interests,
```

```
(3) The maint undertaken is sufficient to render serviceability and not surpass the
normal standard for the area or facilities.
```

```
(4) That works has been tasked via the CMO / CIMIC team as part of the Effects
battle rhythm, approved by the Comd and detailed as an OPS FRAGO or TASKO.
```

**COMMAND AND SIGNAL**

15. **CMO Coordinating and Liaison Architecture.** TECHCON will be established
    by HQ TG 667.2 G9 from PH 1 to all TG 667.2 Bde S9 staff to assist in
    overall coordination of CMO activity and allocation of resources. TG 667.2
    G9 will establish comms to the CJTF CMOC in General Santos City. TG 667.2 G9
    will remain in loc with HQ TG 667.2 for all phases.
16. **Reports and Returns.** All TG 667.2 Bde S9 are to ensure daily CMO SITREP
    is compiled and forwarded to HQ TG 667.2 NLT 2100H daily. The format for the
    CMO SITREP is at Appendix 5. Significant CIMIC contacts are to be recorded
    as CHATREPS and forwarded on completion NLT 12h following contact. Layout is
    noted at Appendix 6.
17. **Communications.** CMO elements requiring interactions with the HN Govt, UN
    Agencies or IO/NGOs must come complete with civilian mobile phones, network
    data devices and civilian means laptop computers to be able to effectively
    pass and collect information from these sources. As a minimum, elements must
    have the following communications means;

a. Civ Telecom land line phone with answering device and facsimile capabilities.
These may need to be source in country given the power supply incompatibility
with the AS power system.

b. Civ Mobile phones for voice, text, and NGO chat app usage. The SIM cards must
be sourced in country and care must be exercised given the FIS collection
capabilities within that system.

c. CIMIC PC laptops with non military email accounts as established prior to in
country operations. These can be connected to the data communications system via
network devices but will also require local telecom data network SIM cards. This
LAN system is to have backup capability and multifunction device capability to
allow printing and scanning of documents and IO products.

d. Those CMO elements should also come with a number of civilian two way hand
held radios compatible with those used by NGOs and must have a charging
capability for those power packs.

e. Elements must come with or be provided with, Military PRR and MBTR radios for
internal sigs and patrol comms. SOIs and CEOIs to be provided from the HQs
elements.

COUNTRY BRIEF (DRAFT FRAMEWORK)
```

BACKGROUND

1. The island of Panay was formerly a possession of the Skolkan Empire along
   with Palawan, Cebu, Negros, and Bohol. After the empire’s collapse in the
   early 20th century, Panay declared independence but was subsequently absorbed
   into the Belesian Federation after a period as a protectorate of Torrike,
   former seat of the Skolkan Empire. Panay’s two main population centres are
   Caticlan in the north and Iloilo in the south. Panay is also home to the San
   Rafael Cerium mine, where one of the world’s few concentrated rare earth
   mineral deposits is located. Since its shift from gold ore extraction to
   Cerium mining, San Rafael has both created opportunities and exacerbated
   local ethno-social tensions as well as becoming a focus of regional power
   competition.
2. Panay has never been a willing member of the Belesian Federation being
   culturally distinct owing to its history of Skolkan influence. Over the
   years, strong separatist sentiment has periodically escalated into violent
   revolt, a frequent and costly irritant for the Belesian government. Despite
   this, they have been loth to grant independence, partly from unwillingness to
   compromise the territorial integrity of their young state, and partly owing
   to the revenues generated by the San Rafael mine. These tensions culminated
   in the 1972 massacre of some one hundred and forty four during ethnic clashes
   with the Belesian paramilitary police officers. This event, dubbed “The Ash
   Wednesday Massacres”, resulted in Panay being granted autonomous home rule.
   Relations between the local Panay government and Belesian central authorities
   have yet to be normalised, and Ash Wednesday has become a frequent catchcry
   for separatist elements in Panay.
3. Panayan internal politics are no less fraught. The mine, which is integral to
   the local economy, is largely worked by Torbian immigrants who have to some
   extent monopolised mining employment on the island. While the mine itself is
   owned by Panay (and therefore nominally by Belesia), much of the plant and
   infrastructure was acquired through Olvanan investment. The Torbian immigrant
   population is the most sizeable ethnic minority, making up some 32% of the
   island’s total population, having arrived in Panay shortly after WWII as
   indentured labour for the San Rafael mine during its gold extraction period.
   A small Olvanan diaspora, mainly concentrated in Caticlan around Olvanatown
   and the recently established Olvanan trade mission set up to safeguard
   Olvanan interests in San Rafael, is the next largest ethnic minority. The
   remaining bulk of the island’s population identify as Panayan.

ETHNIC GROUPS

4. Panayan: The Panayan people share a common heritage with the broader Belesian
   population, but are culturally distinct. This is partly owing to their
   position near the Western hinterland of the archipelago which has a high
   concentration of unmixed indigenous tribes, but is mostly to do with the fact
   that Panay is majority Christian, the island having been largely insulated
   from the spread of Islam through the region in the 15th century by Skolkan
   rule. This has led to significant differences in culture, custom, and world
   view between the

inhabitants of Panay and the rest of the Belesian Federation. The majority of
Panayans feel marginalised by the majority Islamic Belesian state, and despite a
heavy Christian presence within the Belesian military, the Christians of Panay
feel disadvantaged and sometimes persecuted by their Muslim neighbours. This
disaffection has allowed the Visayan People’s Front (VPF), a separatist
Christian armed insurgent group, to maintain a strong presence on the island.

5. Torbian: The Torbian diaspora has a long history in Belesia in general and
   Panay in particular, many Belesians having mixed Torbian ancestry. The
   Torbian population on Panay, however, has failed to integrate into Panayan
   society. Given their size, making up one third of the local population,
   Torbians on Panay have been a largely self-sustaining, self-referential
   community. While their original status as indentured labour is no longer in
   effect, the Torbians on Panay remain an underclass, being economically
   disadvantaged even relative to the high levels of youth and rural poverty in
   the region, and driven into insularity by periodic racial scapegoating over
   their long history on the island. This has led to the Torbian population
   demonstrating unusually high levels of ethnic tribalism, which acts to drive
   a further wedge between them and the indigenous population of Panay.
6. Olvanan: The Olvanan diaspora in Belesia possesses disproportionate social
   and economic power, and the Olvanan minority on Panay is no exception.
   Despite making up only a small percentage of Panay’s population, Olvanans own
   a sizeable chunk of the island’s wealth and are significantly overrepresented
   within the island’s educated, business and property owning middle class. This
   has led to a long history of mistrust and resentment between the Panayan and
   Olvanan populations, not helped by the history of antagonism between their
   two nations. These tensions have been further exacerbated by the recent
   upsurge in Olvanan activity on the island, the Olvanan government having
   invested heavily in roads, ports, and other mine related infrastructure. This
   investment has come at the cost of punishing royalties and loan repayments
   overseen by the recently established Olvanan trade mission in Caticlan. The
   mine, Olvanatown, and especially the trade mission, have become symbolic
   targets for Panayan resentment of the far more prosperous Olvanan minority.

POLITICAL AND SECURITY — INTERNAL

7. The autonomous government of Panay is a small, beleaguered, and highly
   corrupt institution with a poor record in delivering services, especially to
   the Torbian community centred on the San Rafael mine. Poor governance and
   lack of interest has resulted in the Panayan government having little to no
   monopoly of force outside Iloilo and Roxas. The tense nature of relations
   with Belesia has meant that not only has the BF been extremely unwilling to
   involve itself in Panayan affairs at any level, it has also resulted in the
   island being effectively cut off from services and other benefits available
   to Federation members. Conversely, significant revenues from the San Rafael
   mine flow out to the BF government as part of the home rule agreement, and
   this has led to increased levels of resentment amongst Panayans towards the
   rest of Belesia. This coupled with the memory of The Ash Wednesday Massacres
   has made the Belesian authorities deeply reluctant to intervene overtly in
   Panayan affairs.
8. The Roman Catholic Church is a major player in Panay, being a de facto
   provider of many services a more functional government would ordinarily
   supply. The RCC has strong and deep roots within most Panayan communities
   both religious and secular, and its

international character has led to some suspicion that factions within the local
cathedral communities might be partisan actors or at least logistical links for
Olvana and Torbia.

9. Given the marginalisation of the Torbian population on Panay, the Torbian
   community has become largely self-sufficient in terms of service delivery and
   security. Localised committees organise essential services such as garbage
   collection and education, and what little policing and security which exists
   is administered via small localised militias formed from past and present
   private security contractors hired either by the Olvanan trade mission or the
   historical owners of the mine. This has led to what is effectively a Torbian
   enclave in the immediate environs of the mine, with smaller satellite
   enclaves existing in the major population centres.
10. The Olvanan trade mission represents a syndicate of Olvanan SOEs which,
    between them, own the major port facilities in both Caticlan and Roxas, the
    main trunk roads linking these ports with the San Rafael mining complex, and
    large gated precincts in Caticlan, Roxas, and San Rafael in which technical
    and trade personnel, mostly Olvanans, are housed. They also have major
    interests in the power distribution and generation networks and
    telecommunications infrastructure of Panay. This unusually heavy level of
    investment arises from the fact that the San Rafael mine makes up a
    significant percentage (12%) of Olvana’s total rare earth metal inflows, the
    securing of which is a key Olvanan strategic goal. The segregated nature of
    the Olvanan footprint, and the relative prosperity of Olvanans in Panay, is
    a major source of tension and conflict.
11. Given Panay’s position near the western extremity of Belesia, the island has
    always acted as a nexus for regional licit and illicit trade. Crime levels
    in Belesia are considered high, and Panay is no exception. The principle
    criminal enterprises involve smuggling of people, goods, and/or illicit
    drugs. Local crime syndicates, Olvanan Black Societies, and the Tantoco
    Cartel are highly active in the region. The traffic in drugs, uncustomed
    goods, and labour slaves (mostly Torbian) is estimated to be worth over $1
    billion dollars per annum. It can sometimes be difficult to disambiguate
    Olvanan and Panayan criminal organisations from legitimate centres of power,
    especially at a local level.
12. The Visayan People’s Front is a Christian separatist insurgent militia
    committed to establishing an independent entity composed of the islands of
    Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Bohol. Whilst the Panayan government is not one
    hundred percent aligned with their goals, there is sufficient crossover,
    especially with regard to ethno-religious commonalities, to make the
    relationship between Panayan authorities and the VPF highly ambiguous.
    Additionally, given the general poverty of the island and its role in
    illicit trade routes, the VPF has developed a significant degree of
    interoperability with local and Olvanan criminal syndicates, often turning
    to smuggling and piracy for fundraising purposes. Along with the heavy
    presence of Wagner Group PMCs, VPF militants are frequently used as armed
    security for various criminal and even some legitimate groups across Panay.
13. The Wagner Group has a heavy footprint in Panay. The general inability of
    government to maintain law and order unaided, combined with the Wagner Group
    being the principal contractor providing security for the Olvanan SOEs
    associated with the San Rafael mine, means that Wagner Group PMCs are a
    significant armed body existing within the security matrix of the island of
    Panay. Given that most Wagner Group operatives in the region are of Torbian
    descent, there is significant crossover between the Torbian immigrant
    community and Wagner Group personnel.

14. The Red Tigers Black Society is a major link in the illicit trade route that
    runs through access points north and south of Palawan, as well as elsewhere.
    The Red Tigers are suspected to be in direct competition with the Tantoco
    Cartel for control of the arms, drugs, and people trafficking markets within
    the region. The leadership of the Red Tigers is unknown, but given the
    general character of the group, their head is thought to be a member of the
    Olvanan community.
15. The Tantoco Cartel is the second of the large transnational criminal
    organisations operating in the area, with significant suspected drug and
    weapons markets within and around the San Rafael mine and Torbian workers’
    ghetto. Their leadership is also unidentified, but strong suspicions rest on
    the local police department. It is also thought that the Tantoco Cartel is
    the vector for most Wagner Group recruitment which occurs off island.

POLITICAL AND SECURITY — EXTERNAL

16. The Local Panayan Government has a UN mandate for independence, but is in
    reality a semi-autonomous member of the Belesian Federation. This
    complicates Panay’s external security situation, creating a triangle effect
    between Panay, Belesia, and the external power in question.
17. At this point in time, Belesia is embroiled in an EEZ dispute with
    neighbouring South Torbia, a major aspect of which concerns the San Rafael
    mine. This has led to a number of minor cross maritime border incidents
    between Panay/Belesia and South Torbia.
18. Belesian relations with Olvana, a regional hegemon within easy reach, are
    highly complex. On the one hand, Olvanan investment is eagerly sought after
    by all of the islands of the Belesian Federation, including and especially
    Panay. On the other hand, however, the strategic interests of the two
    nations often clash, and Olvana and Belesia are currently embroiled in
    maritime territorial disputes, both nations frequently conducting
    provocative FONOPS. Panay itself is increasingly at odds with Olvana over
    what is perceived to be Olvana’s rapacious financial exploitation of the San
    Rafael mine.
19. Belesia’s relationship with the small island nation of Gabal is described as
    good. Gabal’s neutrality and relative unimportance help to facilitate this.
20. In the broader region, North and South Torbia are experiencing a periodic
    cooling of their perennial conflict. This has freed South Torbia to pursue
    its other claims and disputes and is the cause of South Torbia’s current
    intense focus on its disputes with Belesia/Panay. Belesia is one of the few
    nations which has cordial relations with North Torbia.
21. Olvana’s expansionist strategy has ruffled the feathers of many of its
    regional neighbours, including Belesia and South Torbia, but there is little
    expectation at present of these tensions leading to a major conflict in the
    immediate future. Having said that, Olvanan military activity has ramped up
    significantly over recent years. At present, Olvana and North Torbia are
    currently conducting Ex RISEN SWORD, a biannual interoperability and
    cooperation exercise, in the South China Sea west of Palawan Island and just
    outside Belesia’s EEZ.

22. Belesia has generally good relationships with the US and its allies,
    specific economic or territorial disputes aside. At present, there is a high
    level of information and personnel exchange between the Belesian military
    and western powers active in the region including Australia, New Zealand,
    and the USA. Panay itself maintains close ties with Torrike, though these
    are generally considered to consist more of a sense of historical kinship
    rather than any more tangible relationship of exchange.

capabilities tied to specific Defence treaties and technology transfer agreements.
While these include GPS, GLONASS, and BDS
(d) It is likely that GPS also provides the backbone for timing for services such as
SATCOM.
(e) SATCOM. NT operates one earth observation satellite that utilizes X-Band
transponders to communicate images for download while in a sun-synchronous
polar orbit with IMINT and pontential ELINT capabilities. NT may also be using
commercial or allied satellites from Olvana, Donovia and other nations.
(f) ELINT. NT’s KMS4 is unlikely to have sophisticated ELINT capabilities,
however NT may have negotiated access to a combination of Olvanian
capabilities including Naval Ocean Surveillance System (NOSS), SIGINT and
supporting precision strike capabilities.

```

(2) Counter-Space Capabilities. Counter Space capabilities are a set of
capabilities that NT may use to deny Coalition space effects: (a) ISR. NT
ability to negate threats from the US, Coalition, and other more sophisticated
opponents is extremely limited and the threat from NT for ISR counter-space will
be minimal. (b) PNT. The ability to counter Coalition use of space-based PNT
will be dependent on NT’s access to COTS technology or jammers acquired from
Olvana, Donovia or other vendor nations or third parties. (c) SATCOM. The
ability to counter Coalition use of space-based SATCOM is UNLIKELY, due to
current capabilities, and the risk of antagonising South Torbia into joining the
conflict.

(3) Launch Capability. The North Torbian Space Agency is UNLIKELY to launch any
successful Satellite payloads. NT allied capabilities are significantly advanced
with Olvania launching 3-4 commercial and military Hi-Res IMINT, SIGINT monthly

```
AB-3/5
through both Land and Sea-based launches. It is assessed that Olvania is LIKELY to
have short-term Satellite Surge launch capacity.
```

b. Coalition Forces.

```
(1) General. The CJTF has access to a limited use of Hi-Res US Keyhole technologies with
Ground Resolution of under 1 metre, via FVEY arrangements.
(2) Space Capabilities. The IBSAF use a wide range of space-based ISR assets, reliant on
GPS and GLONASS. Use of space based PNT and SATCOM by the Coalition is
ubiquitous at all levels; denial of this capability would be debilitating.
(3) Counter-Space Capabilities. The IBSAF may leverage existing legislation from
respective governments to interrupt or restrict service by commercial satellite imagery
providers over the JFAO.
(4) Host Nation (HN).
(a) Belesia (BX). The host nation commercially purchases global positioning
receivers that support commercial needs as well as military navigation and
targeting operations, which may be leveraged for additional bandwidth of
capabilities.

1. **Situation.**

a. North Torbia (NT).

```
(1) SIGINT and EW. NTMEF capabilities are focused on RISTA, Electronic Intelligence
Warfare (EIW) as key to any Offensive or Defensive manoeuvre, specific planning
down to a Division-level are assigned, and executed by manoeuvre forces including
SPF and trained insurgent forces within the AO.
(a) Reconnaissance, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RISTA)
and Counter Reconnaissance Detachments (CRDs) – DTG assets are allocated
in all phases of the Defence and Offense, with a focus on Detection, Disruption
and Electronic of Physical Attacks. A dedicated CRD is assigned per disruption
zone to maximise system warfare principles including C2, Logistics and
Sensors.
(b) The Defensive Main Effort of an NTMEF DTG is the detection of the enemy’s
Main Effort, C2, Logistics nodes, and strategic reserve.
(c) BTG Design of EIW. Focus on disaggregation of C2 nodes, including elaborate
deception plans are typical of Inforwar / Deception C3D plans, involving ghost
formations, realistic manoeuvre deception plans and false emissions in line
with the higher echelon intent.
(d) NTMEF will operate with as little emissions as possible during the pre-battle
phase, within strict schedules and spectrum management. Radio silence or
limited transmission is typical when manoeuvring fires or manoeuvre elements
into place.
(e) Land Forces. NTMEF land ELINT and EW capabilities include: Vehicle-
mounted 1L222 ELINT (8-18 GHz), RASIT, and Tigr-M REI PP LEER mobile
EW units.
(f) SFP and Insurgents. NTMEF forces will employ SPF and provide capacity
building to allied insurgents with Super High Frequency (SHF) and High
Frequency (HF) capabilities for organic long-range communications, and
sustained operations behind enemy lines. Where integrated with civilian
infrastructure, redundancies away from main population centres are established
to ensure sustainment of viable operations they have been compromised.
```

```
(g) Air Force. NTMEF Air Force has a moderate heli-borne EW jamming
capability, employing HIP-J/K and HORIZON platforms.
(h) Sat ELINT. NTMEF rely on the indigenous KMS-4 satellite with limited visual
resolution and ELINT capabilities, however are likely to be supported by allied
Olvanan YAOGAN or Donovian KOSMOS assets which include triangulation
ELINT detection capabilities.
(i) GPS Jamming. NTMEF deploys COTs and specifically designed EXJAMs in
PELs and choke points which can be pre-positioned or remotely activated, just-
in-time emplacements are achieved either through covert of Artillery delivered
means. Activation strategies are known to use Civilian telecommunications and
energy infrastructure, including operatives within the NGOs/OGA networks.
Use of M-GPS Assured Positioning and Timing (A-PNT) reduces but does not
eliminate impacts of EXJAMs or targeted Jamming.
(j) Cyber Operations. The NTMEF employs highly sophisticated and effective
Cyber Offensive operations, synchronised to Strategic and Tactical effects. It is
assessed as HIGHLY LIKELY civilian SCADA infrastructure has been
compromised and can be activated to enhance Disruption activities within
CIVPOP and critical IBSAF nodes. Cyber operations are nominally controlled
at the strategic level and may be activated remotely from outside the AO.
(k) Redundancy. Within the AO of a BTG, as far as practically feasible Line-based
communications and physical means are established to reduce the electronic
signature of NTMEF forces.
```

b. Olvana (OV).

```
(1) Olvanan ELINT/IMINT capabilities may be deployed in support of NT at a National
level including Hi-Res video, ELINT triangulation and millimeter wave 3D mapping
within specified windows as described in Ref A.
```

2. **Mission.** EW will provide support to TG 667.2 during OP CERIUM STEAL IOT
   counter and neutralise enemy EW capabilities.
3. **Execution.**

a. Joint Information Domain Concept of OPs. TG 667.2 will employ Joint Manoeuvre
in the Information Environment (MIE), to take advantage of any opportunities and
mitigating vulnerabilities, IOT operate with freedom within the Information
Environment.

b. Linked to National Objectives. TG 667.2 will plan and execute Joint
Information Warfare through use of Information Related Capabilities (IRCs) in
line with National Objectives directed by National and Integrated IW outcomes.
TG 667.2 is authorised to leverage military capabilities and IRCs to conduct the
following limited activities and objectives within the following constraints:
(1) Centralised Control. TG 667.2’s authority to conduct Joint MIE is
co-ordinated through MSC, IWD and JOC to Assure, Advise and Affect.

```
(2) Decentralised Execution. To execute the InfoWar Combat Functions, SHIELD,
SHAPE, KNOW, aligned with National Objectives. Where executed, simultaneous
manoeuvre should be used to enhance Battlespace effects including Deception.
(3) Limitations. The Australian Government and ADF plans and executes information
warfare to ensure it is legal, policy compliant, ethical, rules-based and measured. As
with other engagements, the ADF will have specified rules of engagement that have
been approved at the highest levels.
(4) Authority and Waivers. CJTF 667 is the lead for the International response,
operational authorities and waivers can be obtained for the implementation of MIE
activities within a specified military operating area. A minimum of 30 days is
required for submission to CJTF 667 for Joint MIE Ops, when responding to an
immediate and impending threat waivers can be submitted with 36 hours’ notice.
(5) Constraints. Lethality and impacts across Time must be considered when planning
MIE, where enduring effects may linger across years. Where practicable, it should be
contained within the operating environment.
(6) Integrated Workforce. MIE will utilise all the IRC’s integrated workforce to leverage
expertise and enhance effects, these support the IBSAF’s Mission to Defeat the
NTMEF within BX.
```

c. Satellite Access Requests. TG 667.2 has limited access to Allied Sat OPS,
where required TG 667.2 will submit a Communications Access Request (CAR)
through Defence Communications Area Master Station Australia (DEFCAMSAUS) via HQ
CJTF 667 J6.

d. Spectrum Frequency Assignment Operating in a Foreign Country. This operation
will utilise a combination of Area, Space and Band assignments. IAW Ref B,
international frequency assignments are to be submitted with a minimum of 90
days’ notice to ensure international frequency requests are managed.

e. Groupings & Tasks.

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: ZULU.**

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. See paragraph 1 of the main body of TG667.2 OPORD 01 (Ref A) and
Annex B - Intelligence.

b. General. Engineer operations for TG667.2 requires a rapid build-up of
Mobility (M)/Counter mobility (CM)/Survivability (S)/General Engineer (GE)
capacity across the Combined, Joint, Interagency domain.

c. Purpose. The purpose of this Annex is to describe the Scheme of Engineer
Operations on Panay during Ph 2 and 3 of OP CERIUM STEAL and provide Engineer
guidance at the Component Command (Div) level.

d. Engineer Intelligence. Refer to Annex B to TG667.2 OPORD 01.

e. Operational Areas.

```
(1) TG667.2 Area of Operations (AO FANNING). The AO FANNING is comprised of the
landmass, airspace and territorial waters (12NM) of Panay Island.
```

f. Terrain and Man-Made Features. See Appendix 4 to Annex B of Ref A.

g. Civil Considerations

```
(1) As an island nation, BX relies on a network of regular maritime ferry and domestic air
services to move personnel and freight amongst its various islands. Typically, the
maritime ferry services are the primary means of inter-island transportation. BX roads
networks on the larger islands are mainly paved. However, there are numerous
unimproved dirt and gravel roads throughout the area, especially on the smaller islands,
or islands with a small population. Disrupting mobility would be easily affected by
damaging paved roads through the use of IEDs or cratering charges. Rural roads do not
receive proper maintenance, leaving them susceptible to damage from the weather and
neglect. The monsoonal season also has a drastic effect on the inland roads with
communities at time being cut off and isolated during severe weather. For more details
on BX terrain, see Ref B.
(2) Most of the region, particularly rural areas, cannot access all modern utilities such as
potable water, electricity, and modern sewage systems. This will cause a reliance on
military electrical, water and sanitation systems.
```

```
AC-2/7
(3) Paramilitary, insurgent, and guerrilla forces operate in BX. This could lead to an
increased use of IEDs in Panay, particularly on main highways and field landing strips,
having a negative impact on mobility.
(4) BX contains a number of heavily populated areas such as the cities on Panay. Enemy
operations in these areas could result in the Host Nation asking for engineers to provide
survivability/force protection, and general engineering assistance.
```

h. Enemy Engineer Forces. See Annex B Intelligence and NT Country Study (Ref C).

i. Friendly Engineer Forces. See Belesian Country Study (Ref B).

2. **Mission.** TG667.2 Engineer Elements will provide Force Level Engineering
   effects to project, protect and sustain the Land Force on Panay.
3. **Execution.**

a. Concept of Engineer Support. The Divisional engineer effort will be centrally
planned and coordinated, and executed by the Divisional organic and assigned
engineers. Theatre planning and coordination for engineer support will be
provided by the Joint Force Engineer, supplemented by elements from 19 Chief
Engineering Works. Divisional level engineering support will be provided by 6th
Engineer Support Regiment (6 ESR) as part of TG667.2.

b. Each Combat Bde within TG776.2 will have organic engineer support to provide
intimate mobility/counter-mobility/survivability support. RAAF Airfield
Engineers (65 Sqn) will provide intimate support to the APOD at Iloilo post
lodgement through the Combat Support Squadrons assigned to each APOD. RAAF
Airfield Engineers will remain OPCON to the CJTF 667 HQ, but may be assigned
TACON to the relevant AO commander.

c. HN engineering capability will be required during Ph 4 Transition operations
to rebuild infrastructure damaged or destroyed during the conflict in Panay.
This may include civilian contractors. The Joint Force Engineer will be
responsible for coordinating all sustainability engineering support across the
JFAO. Div Engineer will be responsible for coordination for all sustainability
engineering operations within Panay.

d. Scheme of Engineer Operations. TG667.2 Engineers will provide and synchronise

(2) EOD within 6 ESR and CERs will conduct tactical activities to address explosive
hazards. Combat engineer unit activities include the detection, reporting, breaching and
clearing of minefields, and the detection, reporting, and destruction of IEDs. Only EOD
units and properly qualified EOD personnel shall conduct EOD procedures against
```

```
AC-5/7
explosive ordnance, UXO, or IEDs. Attempts will be made to render safe explosive
devices for intelligence gathering efforts if the situation does not affect the local
population and TG667.2 ability to accomplish the mission being undertaken.
(3) IEDs/Booby-Traps. TG667.2 will not employ booby-traps or IEDs.
(4) Mines. COMD TG667.2 is the emplacement authority for AT mines in AO FANNING.
Artillery delivered mines will not be utilised by TG667.2. Anti-tank mines, if utilised,
will be surface laid. No AP mines will be utilised.
(5) Humanitarian Demining (HDM). Because of the threat to peace and safety, HDM has
become a significant disarmament and peace operations activity. Demining is ultimately
an HN responsibility; however, TG667.2 may assist BX through mine awareness
education and training of HN personnel in the surveying, marking, and clearing of
mines during Ph3.
```

k. Geospatial. Div and formations will deploy with integral terrain analysis
capabilities. Div geospatial support will be provided by 5 Coy, 1 Int Bn.

l. Firefighting. The CERs will provide close firefighting capabilities ISO RW
operations. These firefighting capabilities will be OPCON to 16 Avn Bde during
Ph1 – 3. 6 ESR will be responsible for TG667.2 policy on firefighting
capabilities for TG667.2 facilities. TG667.2 fire protection priorities are: (1)
APODs and SPODs. (2) Medical facilities. (3) Ammunition and fuel storage
installations. (4) TG667.2 Headquarters and communication centres.

m. Reach back. The Div Engineer will reach back to the Joint Force Engineer will
facilitate the utilisation of NSB engineer capabilities. All requests for
assistance will be passed to the Joint Force Engineer based out of General
Santos City.

n. Host Nation Support. TG667.2 Engineers will maximise the use of Host Nation
(civilian) engineer support. Host-Nation Support planning considerations include
the following: indigenous labour; local availability of construction materiel,
supplies, and equipment; local contractor support; and local facilities.

o. Construction Standards.

```
(1) When new construction is the only means of sourcing facility requirements, it will be
constructed either using respective TCN standards or using temporary guidelines (less
than six months) found in extant Doctrine and Policy.
(2) Expedient construction (e.g., rapid construction techniques such as pre-fabricated
buildings, clamshell structures, etc.) should also be considered as these methods can be
selectively employed with minimum time, cost, and risk to offer in-theatre forces
another source of required temporary facilities.
```

4. **Sustainment.**

```
AC-6/7
```

a. Logistics. Engineer Units will deploy with their own organic logistic
support, and will receive additional support from their supported formations.
During Ph2, priority of availability for CL IV supply will be lower. CL IV
supplies will be limited to what formations will bring as part of basic
defensive stores.

b. Medical. Engineer Units will deploy with their own organic medical assets
(RAP), and will receive additional support from their supported formations (R1 –

1. **Situation.**

a. Background. North Torbia invaded Palawan and Panay, claiming to protect
ethnic Torbians from persecution because of recent tensions that were
precipitated by the clashes over control of the Panayan San Rafael Mine Complex.
The North Torbian Marine Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) deployed the 4th Marine
Brigade Task Group (BTG) to secure the seaport and airport facilities in the
town of El Nido in Palawan before deploying the 3rd Marine BTG to capture the
Panayan Island northern city of Roxas City. The NTMEF is based on the Torbian
Marine Expeditionary Division of the Torbian People’s Army (TPA), Western Army
Command. It has an integrated command structure, which includes ground, air and
maritime components. The 3rd MAR BTG quickly expanded to capture the northern
half of Panay, including the seaport and airport facilities at Caticlan. The 3rd
MAR BTG advanced quickly south to capture Passi and Sara and the San Rafael Mine
Complex after only token resistance from local Belesian Militia and
Constabulary. It is assessed that the 3rd MAR BTG has been helped by the Visayan
Peoples Front (VPF) by disrupting Belesian Federation Defence Force (BFDF)
efforts in any coordinated defence. The BFDF landed the 12th Infantry Bde two
days after the initial invasion at the sea and airport facilities near Iloilo
City. The BX 12th Inf Bde advanced north to stop further 3rd MAR BTG advanced
south and to defeat the NTMEF on Panay. However, the fighting has quickly ground
to a stalemate with the 12th Inf Bde pushed back to Iloilo City and holding
defensive positions. This status of affairs has been in place for three weeks
with the NTMEF showing no signs of expanding further beyond the defensive lines
established along the Passi-Sara-Estancia line. The strategic message from Nth
Torbia is that they are not the aggressors and have no wish to annex Panay and
are content to maintain their defensive line until law and order is established
to protect ethnic Torbians in Panay. The International Belesian Security
Assistance Force (IBSAF) has been established under a UN mandate to remove NTMEF
presence in Belesian sovereign territory. The Combined Joint Task Force 667
(CJTF 667) is the military component of IBSAF. Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS) is
the Joint Campaign Plan for the removal of

```

```

the NTMEF from Belesian territory. Operation CERIUM STEAL (OCS) is the land
component campaign plan of OSS for the liberation of Panay. X Bde, as part of 1
Div (an AS led multi- national force) will participate in ground operations in
Panay to remove all NTMEF elements. OCS will commence after sea and air lanes
from staging bases in General Santos City and Zamboanga (Mindanao) to Panay have
been established, and that interdiction from NTMEF maritime and air components
no longer pose a significant threat to amphibious operations.

b. Strategic Aim. The aim of the international community is to:

```
(1) end North Torbian aggression towards Belesia
(2) expulsion of all North Torbian military forces from Belesian sovereign territory
(3) creation of a free, safe, secure and stable environment in the region
(4) continuation of Belesian democratic national governance and developmental
programs.
```

c. Strategic Objectives. In order to achieve the desired end state, the
strategic objectives of the international intervention include:

```
(1) Expel all North Torbian military forces from Belesian sovereign territory.
(2) Restore a secure and stable environment throughout the BX Joint Force Area of
Operations (JFAO).
(3) Effect force protection for coalition military forces deployed throughout the JFAO.
(4) Assist the government of BX to strengthen the capacities of their national security
forces and institutions to enforce central control.
(5) Preserve and enforce the freedom of navigation throughout the JFAO.
(6) Support UN Agencies, International Organizations (IOs) and NGOs within capabilities
and limitations in order to preserve human life and alleviate the suffering of IDPs and
refugees within the JFAO.
(7) Gradually reduce the size, role and profile of the IBSAF contribution. This process
will be guided by reviews of tasks, environment, threat, risks, follow-on forces and
Host Nation (HN) capacities as part of a Transition and Exit Strategy that is linked to
the achievement of the Desired Military Strategic End State.
```

d. Operational Objectives. With the support and agreement of the international
community, IBSAF has undertaken to end the crisis in BX by deploying a combined
joint task force to BX to repel NT invading forces and restore BX territorial
sovereignty. The force, hereafter referred to as CJTF 667 will deploy under the
authority of UNSCR 8873 (ref A). The objectives of this military intervention
are as follows:

```
(1) Establish military superiority in the maritime and airspace within the JFAO in a
manner which supports decisive operations.
(2) Conduct decisive military operations, which leads to the restoration of Belesian
sovereignty in the occupied islands; stabilize the region; and deter further external
aggression against BX.
(3) Assist humanitarian efforts and IO/NGO activities in BX.
```

```

```

```
(4) Assist the government of BX to re-establish and maintain a safe and secure
environment to facilitate the continuance of democratic government institutions and
programmes.
(5) Support any applicable International Criminal Court (ICC) investigations of crimes
against humanity through the preservation and collection of evidence.
```

e. To this end, a ground force, designated TG 667.2 is to deploy to the BX
island of PANAY to expel NTMEF from the island, defeat the ongoing insurgency
and to return control to the BX authorities.

f. Tactical Objectives. As part of TG 667.2, X Bde (TU 667.2.1) will achieve the
following objectives to meet the Strategic and Operational objectives:

```
(1) Secure the ILOILO CITY APOD/SPOD to enable lodgement of TG 667.2 FE
(2) Generate combat strength on PANAY to enable decisive action
(3) Conduct decisive actions against the 3rd MAR BTG
(4) Secure key terrain and infrastructure on PANAY
(5) Set conditions to enable transition of authority in PANAY back to BX
```

g. End State. The desired endstate for X Bde will have been the defeat of the
3rd MAR BTG within AO and set the conditions for the transition of authority on
PANAY to UN or BX.

h. Limitations.

(1) General. NT has projected forces onto the BX island of PANAY IOT control the
mineral resources, and to foster a viable alternate government that seeks to protect the
Torbian minority of PANAY.
(2) NTMEF located on PANAY. The principle land component of the NTMEF located on
PANAY is the 3 Marine BDE Task Group (BTG) supplemented with DIV troops. The
HQ is located in the city of ROXAS CITY in the N of PANAY. 34 MAR BDET is in
mobile defence in the vic of the SAN RAFAEL mine, 32 MAR BDET is conducting
mobile defence in the vic of SARA, 31 MAR MBET is located in ESTANCIA, and the
33 MER BDET is defending IVO PASSI. The 3 MAR Tank Bn is in reserve IVO
ROXAS CITY to CATK any AS advance N from ILOILO CITY or landing forces on
the E coast. Recent intelligence suggests that the 3 Marine BDE has been reinforced
with a Tank Coy equipped with T-72Bs. The NTMEF is positioned to prevent the
return of control to the BX authorities IOT to gain time to legitimise their occupation
through Information Warfare. 3 MAR BDE is supported by a BN size organisation of
insurgents from the Visayan Peoples Front (VPF):

AVN Bde) operating out of the ILOILO CITY APOD, and the BX 12 Bde operating in
AO ONSLOW. CJTF and Divisional troops will also be operating in the AO (see
Annex A to Ref E for more details).

l. International Organizations (IOs) and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Some IOs and NGOs are currently operating in BX. Their presence is expected to
increase dramatically once a more secure operating environment is created. See
Annex Q of the Ref F for further details.

2. **Mission.** X Bde is to defeat all NTMEF within AO GLADSTONE IOT create
   conditions for a safe and secure PANAY to return to Belesian authority.
3. **Execution.**

a. Commander’s Analysis. The occupation of Panay by North Torbia is an
unacceptable act of aggression against the sovereignty of Belesia and the
international rule of law. X Bde will enforce UNSCR 8873 to restore Belesian
sovereignty over Panay and enabling humanitarian aid to ease the suffering of
the civilian population of Panay. The NTMEF on Panay is a capable force and will
provide a challenging adversary. Also noted is that the local politics of Panay
is complicated. The history of Panay within the Belesian Federation has been
fractious and we must be cognisant that our forces are not embroiled in the
local politics. There are elements within the local Panayan population that may
not be pleased with our presence. We will not antagonise the Panayan population
with wanton destruction of infrastructure and avoiding where possible collateral
damage. It is important that our actions are conducted within international
guidelines and that care to reduce collateral death and damage to non-combatants
is utmost in all planning considerations. Subordinate commanders at all levels
must be alert to these factors in the conduct of all of their operations,
particularly as we transition from combat operations.

b. Commander’s Intent. X Bde will conduct decisive actions against the NTMEF
within AO GLADSTONE, utilising manoeuvre and superior precision fires to
neutralise the NTMEF’s defensive advantages. Additionally, we will capitalise on
our moral advantage by targeting the enemy’s limited support from the local
Panayan population through effective strategic communications, information
operations and by our effective use of force. However, I will not expose the
lives of Coalition troops by holding back on the use of force where the use of
all Coalition assets is appropriate and necessary. The NTMEF must be made aware
that our determination and resolve will see us complete our mission to the
maximum permissible under international law. It is my intent that the NTMEF is
defeated on Panay and that authority for the governance of Panay is handed back
to the Belesian Government or a UN appointed provisional authority.

A. Purpose: Defeat NTMEF and insurgency forces within AO GLADSTONE. B. Method:
The X Bde contribution to Operation CERIUM STEAL will be a three-phase
operation, with a preliminary phase, nested within Operation STEEL SENTINEL
(OSS). Phase 0 will see the preparation of all ground forces for lodgment onto
PANAY (including embarkation on maritime assets). Phase 1 will consist of an
amphibious and air lodgement of the TU into ILOILO CITY APOD/SPOD. Phase 2 will
result in the Neutralisation of the NTMEF by dislocating and then defeating them
in battle. During Phase 2, X BDE will ADV N and defeat NTMEF forces loc IVO of
PASSI complex, and cut-off LoC to the alternate APOD/SPOD in CATICLAN. This will
dislocate the NTMEF forces IVO ROXAS CITY and set the conditions

```
UNCLASSIFIED
```

```

UNCLASSIFIED
```

for Y BDE to defeat these forces in detail and secure ROXAS CITY. Phase 3 will
be the transition of authority back to the BX government. At all times, we must
be cognisant that the main effort is the removal of NT forces in BX. If this can
be achieved during any of the stages without further bloodshed, then all effort
must be taken to explore those options.

C. Endstate: The liberation of PANAY and removal of NTMEF forces and
establishment of a safe and secure environment in PANAY with X Bde postured for
stability operations.

c. Main Effort. The main effort is dislocating the 3rd MAR BTG in ROXAS CITY by
securing ROUTE BLUE and cutting off supply through the alternate APOD/SPOD at
CATICLAN.

**INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY**

**References:**

A. CJTF 667 OPORD 01 – OP STEEL SENTINEL

B. Belesia (BX) Country Study

**Time Zone Used Throughout the Order: Zulu.**

1. **Situation**

a. Characteristics of the Operational Environment (OE).

```
(1) See Ref A, Annex B, Appendix 4 and ODIN.
```

b. Enemy Evaluation.

```
(1) Under the stated aim of “liberating ethnic Torbians from the oppressive governance of
the Belesian government”, North Torbia (NT) invaded the Belesian (BX) islands of
Palawan and Panay with the NT Marine Expeditionary Force (NTMEF) landing on
Palawan on ( insert date ) and Panay on (insert date). The NTMEF utilised the cover of a
biennial exercise with Olvana (Ex RISEN SWORD) to muster forces to commence their
OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, the annexation of Panay. The first phase of OP
RIGHTEOUS HARMONY saw the landing of NTMEF elements to capture an old
airfield and seaport in the north Palawan town of El Nido. Establishing El Nido as a
logistic staging base, within 24hrs NT landed (utilising amphibious and heli-borne
troops) and captured the seaport, airport and other key locations of the northern Panayan
city of Roxas. Roxas was the scene a few months earlier of rioting, which resulted in the
deaths of over one hundred ethnic Torbians. Little effective resistance was encountered
during the capture of El Nido and Roxas. It is estimated that the NTMEF has landed a
Marine Brigade (4th Marine Bde) in El Nido and established a logistic node to support
operations on Panay. The NTMEF HQ is also identified to have setup in El Nido to
better coordinate C2 and sustainment operations. The NTMEF is estimated to have
landed a reinforced Marine Brigade (3rd Marine Bde Task Group) in Panay. Shortly
after taking control of Roxas, the 3rd Marine BTG has advanced south and established a
defensive line approximately along Calinog – Passi – San Rafael - Sara. Conveniently,
this defensive line incorporates the San Rafael Mine complex, a key strategic asset in
Panay that produces a large quantity of rare earth metals, notably Cerium.
(2) In response to the capture of Roxas, the Belesian Federation Defence Forces (BFDF)
landed a Brigade (12th Infantry Bde) in the southern Panayan city of Iloilo. The 12th Bde
is a light infantry unit, so could be deployed at a relatively short notice. However, the 12
Bde did not have the combat power to defeat the NTMEF 3rd Marine Bde. Initial
advances north from Iloilo by the BFDF 12th Bde was stopped short of the NTMEF
defensive line and has since resulted in a stalemate with the majority of the 12th Bde
holding defensive positions around Iloilo to secure the sea and airport.
(3) The NTMEF has declared a Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) over northern Palawan, half of
Panay and the sea and air lanes connecting the two islands. The NTMEF has reinforced
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
their hold in Palawan and Panay with SU-30MKK fighter-bombers, and J-11B fighters,
along with active patrolling in the Sulu Sea between Palawan and Panay. Aside from
organic elements within the two NTMEF Marine Brigades, there have been reports of
HQ-16 SAMs, 122mm MLR batteries and other NTMEF Division troops in El Nido and
Roxas. It appears that not all NT Marine Expeditionary Division elements have been
deployed to Palawan or Panay. The remaining two Marine Brigades are reported to still
be in North Torbia and it is estimated that the NT armed forces do not want to escalate
this conflict wider. These two Marine Brigades may also be kept back as a strategic
reserve to reinforce the deployed Marine Brigades as required. Identified NT Naval
elements patrolling the sea-lanes within the declared TEZ include 1x Type 052D
(Luyang III) destroyer, 2x Type 052C (Luyang II) destroyers, 1x Type 051G (Luda)
destroyer, 2x Type 054A (Jiangkai II) frigates, 1x Type 053H3 (Jiangwei II) frigate, and
2x Type 053 (Jianghu V) frigates. Whilst not observed, it is assessed that an unknown
number of up to three Yuan and Song class diesel-electric submarines (SSG) are
operating in and around the sea-lanes between Palawan and Panay. Combat Air Patrols
of fighter aircraft have been observed operating out of El Nido and Roxas in addition to
rotary wing traffic of Z9 helicopters.
```

(4) Overall, the NTMEF are well trained and proficient in conducting combined
arms and joint operations and are capable of limited power projection in the
region. The land forces of the NTMEF are designed for quick deployment and are
therefore lacking in heavier armour, but makes up for this deficiency in a
larger number of combat units within each Marine Brigade. It is expected that
the 3rd Marine Brigade in Panay will have been augmented with additional
Divisional troops such as an MRL Battery, an HQ-16 SAM AD Battery and
significant Engineer troops. Additionally, there are reports that the 3rd Marine
BTG has been reinforced with a T-72B Tank Coy from the mainland (suspected from
the 6th Mech Div of the Southern Army Command) to provide additional firepower.
Similarly, the NTMEF maritime and air capabilities are also significant and
capable with several platforms of Tier 1 or 2 capability (<15 years old).
Finally, all NTMEF assets are under a unified command similar to a JTF based on
the Marine Division HQ. It is noted that NT has significantly more forces on the
mainland, but is postured along the North and South Torbian border. NT sees a
conflict with Republic of South Torbia (RT) as the more dangerous possibility
and will keep the bulk of its forces poised for a possible RT attack (from their
viewpoint). Consequently, we can expect that NT’s considerable strike
capabilities on the mainland will not be utilised in the conflict in BX as they
are held in reserve for a possible RT attack. Whilst NT has stockpiles of CBRN
weapons, along with the delivery mechanisms for their employment, it is not
expected that the NTMEF will actively use these weapons as their first response.
There are currently no reports of CBRN weapons deployed with the NTMEF.

(5) Enemy Strengths

```
(a) General. NT maintains the second largest military of the five Pacific countries, only
behind Olvana. Militarily, it is a dominant actor within the region, capable of
conducting military action across the spectrum of operations. The NT military
conducts overt, covert, and clandestine operations with ripple effects across the
region. Reporting also suggests ties between elements of NT’s military and criminal
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
and terror groups within the region, which further extends the potential for a global
threat.
(b) Army. The Torbian People’s Army (TPA) is the largest and most influential of the
NT Armed Forces. With compulsory national service, the TPA has a large number
of military trained personnel from which to draw upon. This reflects the stated
nature of the TPA goal as the reunification of the two Torbias. The bulk of the TPA
is located within the Southern and Northern Commands. The Western Command
has the only credible non-land based power projection capability through the NT
Marine Division. This Marine Division reflects the NT shift to power projection
and is therefore well equipped with Tier 1, 2 and 3 equipment. The Marine Division
is slightly different to other TPA Divisions in that it has more Mechanised Infantry
Battalions per Brigade (4 vs 3). However, this is offset by having lighter armoured
vehicles than their non-marine counterparts.
(c) Air Force. The Torbian Peoples Air Force (TPAF) is a capable organisation that is
able to strike any targets within the JFAO. The TPAF has two squadrons of TU-22
bombers that can reach any target within the JFAO. However, these assets are kept
in strategic reserve and are primarily postured to counter any attack by South
Torbia. Instead, for OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY, two squadrons of J-11 fighters
and two squadrons of SU-30MKK fighter-bombers have been allocated to support
the NTMEF. Additional AEW&C, surveillance and tanker support is provided. One
squadron of J-11 and SU-30MKK is operating out of El Nido, with the other
squadrons operating out of the Roxas airport.
(d) Navy. In recent years, the Torbian Peoples Navy (TPN) has greatly expanded its
maritime capability. In order to project power and maintain logistic support, the
TPN has provided significant support to OP RIGHTEOUS HARMONY. The focus
of the TPN in support of the NTMEF is to secure the sea-lanes in and around the
contested islands of Panay and Palawan. The single Luyang III destroyer assigned
to the NTMEF is a significant threat to all aircraft in the TEZ. The NTMEF also
recognises the importance of the Luyang III and has kept this ship in the South
China Sea to secure the link between NT and El Nido, but also out of harm’s way
from possible RT attack.
```

(6) Enemy Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities.

```
(a) Army. The terrain of Panay and Palawan means that travel of armoured vehicles is
restricted and will tend to canalize ground forces along MSRs. The availability of
engineer assets to support maneuverability is limited within the NTMEF. It is
expected that the 3rd Marine BTG will have limited engineer support assets. This is
alleviated somewhat with the amphibious and light armour nature of the NTMEF.
This light amphibious armour nature of the NTMEF will mean that the use of heavy
armour by friendly forces will provide overmatch in most tactical situations. The
only caveat would be the Company of T-72Bs recently assigned to the 3rd Marine
BTG. This armour capability will likely be allocated as the 3rd Marine BTG
COMD’s Reserve.
(b) Air Force: In the event of full-scale combat engagement by modern air forces, the
TPAF would not be able to accomplish more than local air parity for a short period.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
The TPAF ability to project force against NT’s neighbors is not only a source of
national prestige but represents a significant investment on the part of the National
Command Authority (NCA). The NT NCA is unlikely to risk more than a token
loss to a superior force. The training and equipment of the TPAF is below the level
of CJTF 667. Additionally, any strike aircraft from mainland NT will have to fly a
circuitous route along the South China Sea avoiding Republic of Sth Torbian (RT)
airspace, which will reduce their ability to dominate the TEZ. Instead, the TPAF
will have to rely on forces staged out of Palawan and Panay in order to maintain
dominance over the TEZ.
(c) Navy. The TPN has a relatively long line of communication from Panay, through
Palawan back to NT. The TPN ability to enforce the TEZ will be limited in the
relatively close waters of the north Sulu Sea. Being close to RT waters also means
that they will have concerns regarding RT naval vessels monitoring their
movements. Finally, the TPN has invested heavily in its naval vessels and will be
reluctant to expose these assets to complete loss. Hence, it is expected that their
most valuable naval surface vessels will likely remain in the South China Sea with
lower tiered vessels operating in the Sulu Sea (with the exception of their SSGs).
```

(7) Enemy Courses of Action (COAs)

```
(a) Most Likely Course of Action. The strategic goal of the NT occupation of Panay
and Palawan is for a political solution to foster Panayan independence under NT
sponsorship and not to escalate the conflict further. This means that at the strategic
level, NT will be careful not to portray itself as an occupying aggressor. It is likely
that NT will limit its military presence on Panay and Palawan to that of a Marine
Division and supporting maritime and air elements. It is likely that NT will
reinforce the Marine Brigade on Panay with additional Div troops but holding
enough combat power to deter or defeat any offensive attacks by Coalition Forces.
In the event of CF landing ground forces on Panay, the NTMEF will utilise SPF
and local insurgents to disrupt CJTF 667 activities before using maneuver to defeat
or cause attrition to CJTF elements. The NTMEF will continue to maintain the TEZ
with combat air patrols and surface warship patrols. They will remain in a defensive
posture until hostilities commence. Additionally, the NTMEF will likely aim to
cause attrition of CJTF 667 in order to force a diplomatic solution. The NTMEF
will use information warfare to discredit CJTF 667 and BX Defense Forces,
challenge the legitimacy the BX government, tell its “liberation of ethnic Torbians”
story and promote its claim to support Panayan independence. Tactically, the 3rd
MAR BTG will prepare complex defensive positions in and around Passi with the
intent to block CJTF 667 advance north from Iloilo.
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

(b) Most Dangerous Course of Action. The NTMEF will reinforce the ground forces
on Panay with an additional Marine Brigade (likely the 1st Marine Brigade as the
2nd is currently under strength and on a lower readiness cycle). With that
amount of combat power, the NTMEF may be able to capture the southern city of
Iloilo and occupy the entire island of Panay. If Coalition Forces have been
successful in degrading NTMEF capability prior to ground operations, the NTMEF
may commit to capturing Iloilo with just the 3rd Marine BTG or commit to
attacking CJTF 667 ground forces before the Land Component can commence
offensive operations on Panay. The NTMEF will use information warfare to
discredit CJTF 667 and BX Defense Forces, challenge the legitimacy of the BX
government, tell its “liberation of ethnic Torbians” story and promote its claim
to support Panayan independence.

**UNCLASSIFIED**

c. Friendly Forces.

```
(1) Coalition Intelligence Capability. Coalition intelligence organizations, including those
nested within the CJTF will provide all-source intelligence utilising all possible means,
including the establishment of a Multi-National intelligence operations center that will
serve as a central all-source intelligence fusion center supporting operations in the
JFAO.
```

2. **Environmental Effects ASCOPE - Panay (see Ref B for PMESII)**

a. Areas.

```
(1) Panay Island is a relatively large island, the third largest within the Belesian Federation.
The island has many rivers that crisscrosses the low-lying areas towards the central and
eastern parts of the island. There is a mountain range along the western side of the
island that runs north to south along the full length of Panay. This leaves the western
side of the island exposed to the prevailing westerly winds with a narrow corridor
between the mountain range and the sea. The majority of the island is farmland with
pockets of lush jungles and vegetation.
(2) Of the major cities on the island, the two largest are the southern city of Iloilo with a
population of approx. 447,000, and Roxas with a population of approx. 167,000. The
other cities and towns on Panay are predominantly located along the low-lying eastern
part of the island.
```

b. Structures.

```
(1) San Rafael Mine. The San Rafael Mine has been the largest economic generator for
Panay Island. Originally a Copper-Gold mine, the mine was discovered to hold large
deposits of the rare earth, Cerium. Cerium has found use in technology, particularly as
an important component of catalytic converters. As a result of this discovery, Panay has
```

**UNCLASSIFIED**

```
become one of the largest suppliers of Cerium on the world market, accounting for up to
37% of world supplies. The San Rafael Mine is an open-cut mine located south of
Roxas. Co-located with the mine is the refining plant that processes the ore into usable
compounds. During the early 1990’s, the local government of Panay entered into an
agreement with an Olvanan registered mining company to develop the mine beyond just
mining Cu-Au. This has resulted in the San Rafael Mine operators utilising mainly
Torbian workers for much of the dangerous work, with security being provided by a
private military contractor, the Wagner Group. Much of the supporting infrastructure for
the mine comes from Roxas. A dedicated rail system was planned to be constructed
linking the mine with Roxas, but this project has not been able to commence, allegedly
due to corruption within the Panayan local government and intransigence amongst the
wealthy elite. Instead, much of the Cerium ore is transported using trucks. The use of
road transport has meant that the road infrastructure to and from the mine has degraded
significantly. However, the benefit to the local economy has been moderate. The mine
has had a detrimental impact on local environment. In 2015, large quantities of
hydrochloric acid was ‘accidently’ released into the local river system, affecting the
local fauna and flora. For more information on the chemical hazards of the mine see
appendix 2. Noting the recent violence over the perceived lack of wealth distribution of
the mine, it is important to note that Nth Torbian control of the mine will have a serious
effect on the world supply of Cerium.
```

(2) Iloilo City. With a population of nearly 450,000, Iloilo City is the largest
city on Panay. The centre of the Provincial Government is located in Iloilo. The
city boasts relatively modern facilities that you would expect such as the
Iloilo Port and the Iloilo Airport. Medical facilities in the city are
considered good with Iloilo becoming one of the medical tourism hubs in Belesia.
There are three government run hospitals in the city, the _West Visayas State
University Medical Centre_ , _Western Visayas Medical Centre_ , and the _Iloilo
City Hospital_.

**UNCLASSIFIED**

(3) Roxas. As the second largest city on Panay, Roxas is the primary port for
the export of Cerium ore to Olvana. The airport and seaport facilities are not
as large as Iloilo, but is sufficient to serve the needs of the city and the San
Rafael Mine. Roxas Hospital is the only large medical facility in the city.

**UNCLASSIFIED**

(4) Caticlan. This city lies to the northwest of Panay and is the fourth largest
city at 100,000 residents. The only major facilities of note in Caticlan are its
seaport and airport facilities. Whilst the majority of the Cerium ore is sent to
Roxas for worldwide shipping, Caticlan has traditionally served as an alternate
port, especially during the height of Cu-Au mining in the 1980s. Today, Caticlan
is mainly used as a tourist destination where it has direct access to local
island resorts.

### Land Effects (Panay)

- Vegetation
  - Thick jungle vegetation along the western side
  - Farmlands and sub-tropical forests along the lowlands
- Topography
  - Panay is bisected by the Central Panay Mountain Range close to the west
    coast - Highest peak is Mt Madia-as (2,117m)
  - There are may rivers with the longest being the Panay River
  - Most of the population is concentrated on the central and eastern part of
    the island (lowlands)
  - The eastern lowlands contain many farms (sugarcane and rice)
- Assessment
  - Heavy vehicles may be restricted in movement to MSR
  - Will require engineer support to traverse along lowland areas
    (create/reinforce bridges)
  - Wet season will restrict movement significantly

### Land Effects (Panay)

- Urban
  - Iloilo City (pop - 448,000) -

Provincial capital

- Roxas City (pop – 167,000)
- Logistical hubs
- See APOD/SPOD data for Panay
- Single railway linking Roxas and

Iloilo originally used for

sugarcane produce

transportation

- POL sites
- Infrastructure

### Space Effects

- GPS
  - GPS and GLONASS available throughout the region
- Comms

#### Weather Effects -

#### Belesia

- Two seasons: Wet and Dry
  - Dry season Dec – May
  - Wet Season Jun – Nov
- Region is susceptible to tropical typhoons

during the wet season

- Typhoons are regular and generally

occur during Jul to Oct

- On average Belesia is hit by 9

typhoons/year of varying strength

- Temperature is relatively constant all year

as expected in a tropical climate

Assessed Enemy Critical Factors / Decisive Points

**Critical Factors**

- Retaining Passiand GLOCs will enable NTMEF to project forwards
  - This has necessitated the capture of a staging base in Palawan
  - Supply lines will have to traverse through international waters in the South
    China Sea and Sulu Sea
- NTMEF 3 BTG Command will be located in RoxasCity
  - The EN Spt Zone must sptboth Western and Eastern approaches to protect this
    vital logistic node
- North Torbia is relying on local Panayan support to maintain legitimacy of
  invasion
  - North Torbia will foment Panayan dissatisfaction with Belesian Federation
    and spur independence movement

**Decisive Points**

- Identification of IBSAF ME and AoA
- NTMEF GLOCs threatened within AO resulting threats to combat power
- Identify Targets of opportunity to deny key Log Nodes to IBSAF
- Set conditions for the independence of Panay (under North Torbian / Olvanan
  auspices) from

Belesian Federation by exploiting historical ethnic tensions

- Identify deployment of IBSAF COMD Reserve

Assessed Enemy Centre of Gravity

**Operational**

- Control of GLOCs enabling 31 Bdet to sustain and maintain momentum

```

###### Extraction chemistry

- Typical process:
  - Mining of phosphate, ferricarbonate ores
  - Particle size reduction by crushing, grinding
  - Separation from other materials [froth flotation, electrostatic,
    gravitational, electromagnetic]
  - Corrosive extraction of mineral from ore using NaOH, HNO 3 or HClor H 2 SO 4
    – corrosive byproducts generated
  - Filtration
  - Solvent extraction & purification – TICs used – Ion exchange in zeolite
  - Refinement – Calciothermic, electrolytic, Lanthanothermic
  - Production of 99-99.95% purity rare earth elements ready for sale

```
Rhone Poulenc extraction process of rare earth minerals.
Maximises recovery of target elements from a variety of ores
```

```

```

###### Reagents

- Reagents
  - Alkalis and acids - NaOH, HNO 3 or HClor H 2 SO 4
  - Solvents
- Health impact
  - Corrosives, poisons
  - Inflammables

```
6
```

###### By-products

- By -products
  - Typically held as liquids in tailings dams
  - Have been known to leach, seep, overflow, or have levees burst resulting in
    contamination of waterways
  - Caused fish kills, rendered waterways sterile and water unfit for human &
    livestock consumption
  - Low level radioactive waste material from Uranium and Thorium ores
  - Release of airborne fluorides
- Biological impact in human and other species
  - Birth defects
  - Cancer
  - Dental loss
  - Death
  - Leukaemia
  - Liver damage
  - Neurological developmental problems in children
  - Permanent respiratory damage
  - Livestock deaths, birth defects, contamination of meat

```
7
```

###### Mining vs refining threat

- Unless there is a rare earth mineral processing plant in

the vicinity of the mining operation, the ores pose little

chemical and radiological danger

```
8
```

Potential deliberate misuse of reagents

- Reagents stored in large quantities pose a risk for theft

and use in the production of explosive material and

chemical weapon hazard

- Nit ric acid is an essential reagent in the production of

modern explosives on both a laboratory and industrial

scales

- Hydrochloric acid is also readily converted to Chlorine

gas, and is one of the oldest known and effective

chemical weapons

```
9
```

#### Threat scenarios

- If mining and refinery operations are co-located or in

the vicinity of each other, potential for HA and Security

operations

- Humanitarian assistance operations
  - IVO mine sites resulting from environmental effects of tailings

dam spillovers/ leakages or dam wall collapse

- Security operations
  - Unde r circumstances of acid or reagent theft
  - Su spected explosive, chemical or toxic weapon development

by insurgents

```
10
```

San Rafael Mine

San Rafael, Panay

- Cerium Mine
- Former Copper-Gold Mine
- Ore Processing Facility located onsite
- Major economic income for Panay

###### SAN RAFAEL MINE

- Originally a Cu-Au open-cut mine
- Now mainly a Ce mine
- Also located adjacent to the mine is a processing facility

to transform the raw material into transportable ore

- Large quantities of reagents are stored at the processing

facility (last report from pre-conflict):

- 50,000L of Hydrochloric Acid
- 5,000L of Sodium Cyanide
- 3,000L of Hydrogen Sulfide

```
12
```

###### Summary

- The processing of rare earth elements uses chemical

reagents that can be the basis of both explosives and a

CW agent

- If rare earth element mining and refining operations are

co-located, there is potential for theft of some of the

chemical reagents which can be processed into

explosives and/ or CW agent

- Realistic threat scenarios could include HADR or security

operations

### CONOPS OUTLINE – OP CERIUM STEAL

### COMD X Bde (TU667.2.1) Intent

- **Commander’s Intent**
  - **Purpose.** Defeat NTMEF land forces within AO.
  - **Method.** Operation CERIUM STEAL will be a three-phase operation nested
    within Operation STEEL SENTINEL (OSS). Phase 1 will consist of an amphibious
    and air lodgement of X Bde onto Panay through the Iloilo City APOD/SPOD.
    During Phase 2, X BDE will ADV N and defeat NTMEF forces loc N of Passi.
    This will dislocate the NTMEF forces IVO Roxas Cityand set the conditions
    for Y BDE to defeat these forces in detail. Additionally, Z Bde will secure
    the NTMEF alternate APOD/SPOD at Caticlan. Phase 3 will be the transition of
    authority back to the BX government. At all times, we must be cognisant that
    the main effort is the removal of NT forces in BX. If this can be achieved
    during any of the stages without further bloodshed, then all effort must be
    taken to explore those options.
  - **Endstate.** The liberation of PANAY and removal of North Torbian forces
    from PANAY, establishment of a safe and secure environment in the occupied
    Belesian territories, and conditions set for the UN supervised transition of
    authority in Panay back to the Belesian Government

### Critical Assumptions

- Critical Assumptions
  - ADF Armoured vehicles have overmatch against most NTMEF armoured vehicles
  - Armoured vehicles restricted to roads without significant engineering effort
  - Full SOFA and cooperation with Belesia to allow staging of Coalition Forces
    (CF)

from Belesian territory

- X Bd e will not be permitted to kinetically target the San Rafael mine complex
- NTMEF will anticipate and oppose landing
- Air superiority achieved for certain periods over PANAY by coalition forces
- NTMEF on Panay will have been severely depleted prior to Ph1
