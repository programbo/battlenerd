# Enclosed Defence Dispersed

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

The Dispersed Defence exploits urban terrain's concealment and protection to
preserve combat forces while integrating them as a distributed sensor and
firepower system. Forces are dispersed in smallest possible elements consistent
with maintaining security, constructing well-protected positions preferably
below ground level with comprehensive sensor and weapons integration.

## Implementation

### Position Construction

1. Underground Component

   - Reinforced below-ground shelter construction
   - Direct access to fighting positions
   - Protection from indirect fire effects
   - Sensor monitoring capability integration
   - Communication systems hardening
   - Multiple emergency exits
   - Environmental control systems

2. Above Ground Elements
   - Reinforced fighting positions with overhead cover
   - Small arms engagement capabilities
   - Concealment from all angles of observation
   - Multiple firing ports at varied levels
   - Interior assault defense measures
   - Sensor/weapon system integration
   - Emergency evacuation routes

### Force Distribution

- Smallest viable elements
- Maximum dispersion
- Mutual support capability
- Overlapping fields of fire
- Integrated communications

### Defensive Systems

1. Sensor Network

   - Comprehensive surveillance coverage with multi-spectral capability
   - Personal monitoring systems for all personnel
   - Connected to underground command shelter
   - Automated threat detection algorithms
   - Minimal exposure requirement for operators
   - Integrated early warning system
   - Counter-Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) capability

2. Vehicle Integration
   - Section Armored Fighting Vehicle (AFV) concealed in rear building
   - Connected via protected withdrawal tunnel
   - Driver/gunner provide additional security
   - Internal building firing positions prepared
   - Protected vehicle servicing capability
   - Emergency extraction routes
   - Integrated fire support plan

### Engagement Methodology

1. Denial Zone

   - Well-protected positions with overlapping fields of fire
   - Defensive artillery integration plan
   - Autonomous munitions employment
   - Target hunting capability using UAS/UGV
   - Systematic area denial procedures
   - Remote weapon system integration
   - Multiple engagement options

2. Distributed Defense
   - Engage/disrupt enemy forces at maximum range
   - Sensor-enabled artillery targeting
   - Kill zone initiation procedures
   - Armed robotic platform employment
   - Off-route mine deployment
   - Integrated obstacle plan
   - Deception measures

### Battle Management

1. Command and Control

   - Centralized control through underground facility
   - Distributed execution capability
   - Redundant communication systems
   - Clear engagement criteria
   - Automated reporting procedures
   - Emergency protocols
   - Withdrawal coordination plan

2. Support Operations
   - Ammunition resupply procedures
   - Maintenance and repair protocols
   - Medical support arrangements
   - Power management systems
   - Water and sustenance plans
   - Equipment replacement procedures
   - Emergency evacuation plans

## Common Errors

1. System Integration

   - Poor sensor coverage overlap
   - Inadequate communication redundancy
   - Weak power management
   - Limited backup systems
   - Insufficient testing

2. Position Selection
   - Inadequate depth planning
   - Poor mutual support arrangements
   - Weak withdrawal routes
   - Limited observation capability
   - Insufficient concealment
