# Enclosed Maneuvers

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Ground forces with air integration

## Tactical Definition

Enclosed maneuvers encompass specialized movement techniques for navigating
urban terrain while maintaining security. These techniques include enclosure
infiltration, penetration lanes, and urban corridors, designed to enable forces
to move effectively through complex urban environments.

## Implementation

### Penetration Lanes

1. Basic Concept

   - Tactical movement on narrow front across urban terrain
   - Maximum use of cover and concealment
   - Movement primarily within:
     - Foliage structures
     - Narrow spaces between structures
   - Success depends on relative speed vs enemy response

2. Types of Penetration
   - SAP Penetration:
     - Dismounted grouping
     - Creates covered route through buildings
     - Uses successive breaches through walls
     - Employs explosives or mechanical systems
   - Tunnel Penetration:
     - Mounted grouping with armored engineering vehicles
     - Mechanically breaches pathway for vehicles
     - Enables movement through/within buildings
   - Picketed Penetration:
     - Rapid deployment of observation posts
     - Monitors enemy movement
     - Teams interdict enemy axis of advance
     - Multiple OPs along route

### Urban Corridors

1. Basic Definition

   - Route across urban terrain (usually formed road/track)
   - Overwatched by flanking structures
   - Provides concealment from distant observation
   - Offers protection from distant fire

2. Corridor Types

   - Transit Corridor:
     - Passage without securing route
     - Minimal delay requirements
     - Higher risk profile
   - Secured Corridor:
     - Cleared and secured overwatch positions
     - Established security elements
     - Continuous route protection
   - Obscured Corridor:
     - Uses various obscurants:
       - Non-toxic glycol vapor from AFVs/UGVs
       - Specialized low-hazard smoke rockets
       - IR and white phosphorus artillery
     - TI translucent smoke on axis
     - TI opaque obscurants at junctions/dominating points

3. Advanced Corridor Techniques
   - Denied Corridor:
     - Uses incendiary munitions
     - Creates heat zones
     - Denies enemy movement for up to 2 hours
   - Blast Disrupted Corridor:
     - Large explosive volumes in linear pattern
     - Collapses lighter buildings
     - Damages facades of substantial structures
     - Degrades enemy sensors/munitions
   - Canyon Flight Corridor:
     - Below mean crest of structures
     - Used by loitering munitions/UAS
     - Mitigates enemy CUAS capabilities

## Common Errors

1. Poor route selection
2. Inadequate security measures
3. Improper obscuration management
4. Failure to maintain momentum

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban offensive operations
- Supports infiltration missions
- Enables force projection in urban terrain

## Training Considerations

1. Complex terrain navigation
2. Obscuration employment procedures
3. Engineering integration
4. UAS/sensor coordination

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for route planning
- Essential for timing calculations
- Key for security positioning
- Important for obscuration modeling
