# Integrated Enclosure Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain with River Crossing
- Scale: Division/Multi-Brigade Task Force
- Domain: Combined Arms with Joint Effects

## Tactical Definition

Integrated Enclosure Attack involves regrouped and rehearsed combined arms teams
tailored to specific tasks and integrated with joint effects. This approach
draws on historical practices of storm groups and detachments, organizing
attacking forces into multiple functional combined arms task groups executing
distinct tasks either concurrently or sequentially.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: CERN Stage

1. Initial Preparation

   - Infantry Division (INE) or multi-brigade task force targets river crossing
     within urban center
   - Focus on specific objective rather than entire urban area control
   - Establish designated "Orange" safe areas for civilian population
   - Conduct preliminary enemy position assessment

2. Reconnaissance
   - Formation level Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) confirm assessments
   - Prepare targeting for high-value entities with long-range precision fire
   - First echelon brigade augmented by Remote Reconnaissance Company (RRC)
   - RRC control elements advance toward urban perimeter
   - Deploy autonomous and semi-autonomous UAS for screening
   - Install sensor systems in hard-to-reach areas
   - Deploy limited armed Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) for diversions

### Phase 2: Assault Preparation

1. Strike Operations

   - Target revealed enemy weaponry with precision strikes
   - Engage strategic perimeter positions
   - Intensify psychological operations within city limits
   - Escalate electromagnetic warfare operations

2. Force Positioning
   - Two "Toward Enclosure" seizure detachments secure potential crossing sites
   - Second and third echelon brigades regroup into specialized units:
     - Seizure units
     - Assault units
     - Penetration units
   - Deploy advanced Command Posts (CPs) of Integrated Fires Command Forward
   - Position CPs close to front lines for effective coordination

### Phase 3: Integrated Attack

1. Psychological Effects

   - Employ UAS for loudspeaker warnings
   - Execute "Purple Roof Knocking" tactic:
     - Mark buildings with purple smoke munitions
     - Allow set interval for evacuation
     - Strike with precision munitions
   - Use purple smoke in multiple areas as deception

2. Assault Execution

   - Begin in sparsely populated industrial zone
   - Deploy uncrewed mechanized remote combat detachment
   - Controllers operate from secure urban perimeter location
   - Focus on enemy displacement and exposure
   - Accept risk to uncrewed force for tactical advantage

3. Main Attack
   - Three attack detachments advance in leapfrog pattern
   - Secure corridor sections to bridge
   - Use indirect approach to confuse enemy
   - Employ Thermal Imaging (TI) opaque smoke
   - Enable blind navigation by armored vehicles
   - Cover with TI translucent smoke
   - Use obscuring smoke elsewhere as diversion

## Common Errors

1. Insufficient reconnaissance depth
2. Poor coordination of joint effects
3. Inadequate civilian evacuation measures
4. Premature commitment of reserves

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Combines with Purple Roof Knocking
- Supports river crossing operations
- Enables deep penetration missions

## Training Considerations

1. Combined arms coordination
2. Joint fires integration
3. Urban navigation under obscuration
4. Civilian consideration procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for synchronizing multiple elements
- Essential for managing joint effects
- Key for civilian pattern recognition
- Important for deception planning
