# Mine Warfare

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Maritime Domain
- Scale: Strategic to Tactical
- Domain: Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD)

## Tactical Definition

Mine warfare serves as a critical enabler of Olvanan Maritime A2AD strategy,
providing persistent area denial function without active intervention. The goal
is to achieve sea denial for adversary ships and submarines while permitting
free movement for Olvanan platforms.

## Implementation

### Strategic Application

1. Key Areas

   - Defensive mining around critical Olvanan ports
   - Mining of choke points in near/distant seas
   - Protective minefields in seized ports
   - Focused on defensive rather than offensive mining

2. Resource Allocation
   - Stockpile of 80,000-100,000 mines
   - Multiple types for varied applications
   - Sufficient quantity for strategic goals
   - Distributed storage and deployment

### Deployment Methods

1. Platform Types

   - Woe Z Mine countermeasure vessels
   - Airborne platforms
   - Maritime militia fleet
   - Scientific research vessels
   - Covert deployment capability

2. Layered Deployment
   - Landmines in intertidal zone
   - Bottom mines in deeper water
   - Tethered floating mines
   - Propelled warhead mines
   - No untethered floating mines

### Operational Considerations

1. Depth Coverage

   - Shoreline to 1000 meters depth
   - Multiple mine types by depth
   - Layered defensive approach
   - Integration with other A2AD systems

2. Legal Compliance
   - Avoid untethered floating mines
   - Maintain legitimate military power status
   - Document deployment locations
   - Enable safe civilian passage

## Common Errors

1. Poor depth calculation
2. Inadequate pattern planning
3. Insufficient documentation
4. Weak integration with other systems

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for A2AD strategy
- Supports naval operations
- Enables area denial

## Training Considerations

1. Mine deployment procedures
2. Pattern planning methods
3. Documentation requirements
4. Integration techniques

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for pattern planning
- Essential for depth calculations
- Key for deployment timing
- Important for integration planning
