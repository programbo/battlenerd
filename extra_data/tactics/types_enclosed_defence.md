# Enclosed Defence

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

Channeled defense exploits the channeling nature of urban terrain to shape enemy
forces into trapping arrays where they are engaged at a relative advantage to
the defender, principally by remote attack within killing zones.

## Implementation

### Engagement Strategy

1. Remote Systems

   - Deploy demolitions, mines, robotics
   - Enable lethal autonomous mode
   - Degrade enemy capabilities
   - Employ direct fire weapons
   - Use precision munitions under obscuration

2. Engagement Sequence
   - Drive enemy into prepared cover
   - Pre-position command demolitions
   - Prepare munitions traps
   - Execute multi-stage engagement
   - Maintain tactical flexibility

### Defensive Preparation

1. Position Selection

   - Exploit natural channeling features
   - Prepare multiple engagement areas
   - Establish observation posts
   - Position remote weapons
   - Enable depth defense

2. System Integration
   - Coordinate autonomous systems
   - Establish sensor networks
   - Enable remote engagement
   - Maintain communications
   - Support rapid response

### Combat Operations

1. Initial Response

   - Engage from protected positions
   - Function as additional OPs
   - Use indirect fire/robotics
   - Limit direct fire exposure
   - Maintain tactical flexibility

2. Counter-Penetration
   - Execute by small groupings
   - Use demolitions/robotics
   - Deploy thermobaric weapons
   - Conduct standoff attacks
   - Avoid close assaults

## Common Errors

1. Poor position selection
2. Inadequate system integration
3. Over-reliance on direct fire
4. Insufficient depth in defense

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban defense
- Supports area denial
- Enables force preservation

## Training Considerations

1. Remote system operation
2. Demolition employment
3. Sensor integration
4. Counter-penetration drills

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for position selection
- Essential for system integration
- Key for engagement timing
- Important for force preservation
