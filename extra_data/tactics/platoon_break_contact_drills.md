# Platoon Break Contact Drills

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Platoon level (30-40 personnel)
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations with Fire Support

## Tactical Definition

Advanced tactics for disengaging from enemy contact in urban warfare, designed
to safely withdraw troops from unfavorable engagements while maintaining combat
effectiveness. The drill emphasizes the principle that "it is foolish if all
rush together and all die together," utilizing coordinated, sequential
withdrawal under covering fire.

## Implementation

### Initial Contact Response

1. Immediate Actions

   - Swift reaction to enemy contact
   - Deploy smoke and high explosive ordnance
   - Disengage from direct line of fire
   - Commander's group advances to counter
   - Create spin maneuver effect
   - Establish base of fire positions
   - Enable systematic withdrawal

2. Base of Fire Establishment
   - Rapid platoon element consolidation
   - Form robust base of fire positions
   - Lead element contributes crossing fire
   - Achieve tactical superiority
   - Maintain suppressive fire coverage
   - Enable maneuver elements
   - Coordinate supporting weapons

### Disengagement Sequence

1. Fire Support Coordination

   - Commander's group equipped with heavy weapons
   - Provide continuous situational awareness
   - Maintain covering fire on upper levels
   - Command and control over breach points
   - Enable systematic withdrawal
   - Coordinate supporting fires
   - Manage ammunition expenditure

2. Movement Control
   - Methodical withdrawal by sections
   - Maintain continuous suppressive fire
   - Use terrain features effectively
   - Execute bound-by-bound movement
   - Repeat until clear of engagement area
   - Maintain tactical integrity
   - Preserve combat power

### Post-Contact Actions

1. Reorganization

   - Rapid reorganization after breaking contact
   - Coordinate with mechanized units (e.g., ZBD-05s)
   - Account for all personnel and equipment
   - Assess ammunition status and redistribute
   - Prepare for subsequent operations
   - Establish security perimeter
   - Conduct battle damage assessment
   - Document enemy tactics/capabilities

2. Coordination Requirements
   - Link up with supporting elements
   - Establish new defensive positions
   - Report contact details to higher command
   - Maintain all-round security during reorganization
   - Coordinate medical evacuation if needed
   - Plan contingency actions
   - Prepare situation reports
   - Update tactical intelligence

### Support Requirements

1. Fire Support Integration

   - Pre-planned fire support coordination
   - On-call fire support arrangements
   - Smoke mission preparations
   - Artillery/mortar integration
   - Close air support procedures
   - Attack helicopter coordination
   - Electronic warfare support
   - Counter-battery preparations

2. Logistics Support
   - Emergency resupply procedures
   - Casualty evacuation plans
   - Ammunition redistribution
   - Equipment recovery plans
   - Vehicle support coordination
   - Medical support arrangements
   - Communication resupply
   - Emergency equipment cache access

## Common Errors

1. Fire Support Coordination

   - Poor fire support timing
   - Inadequate smoke employment
   - Weak supporting fires integration
   - Limited ammunition management
   - Insufficient suppression effects

2. Movement Control

   - Inadequate suppression during bounds
   - Poor use of available cover
   - Weak section coordination
   - Loss of tactical cohesion
   - Insufficient speed in execution

3. Command and Control

   - Loss of situational awareness
   - Poor communication discipline
   - Weak control measures
   - Inadequate contingency planning
   - Limited battlefield visualization

4. Support Integration
   - Insufficient use of smoke/obscuration
   - Poor mechanized support coordination
   - Weak logistics integration
   - Limited medical support planning
   - Inadequate equipment recovery plans

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban operations
- Supports larger maneuver operations
- Enables force preservation
- Integrates with fire support plans
- Supports deception operations
- Enables tactical flexibility
- Facilitates force protection
- Maintains combat effectiveness

## Training Considerations

1. Section/Platoon Coordination

   - Movement coordination drills
   - Fire support integration
   - Communication procedures
   - Emergency action drills
   - Battle handover techniques

2. Support Integration

   - Smoke employment procedures
   - Vehicle support coordination
   - Casualty evacuation drills
   - Resupply procedures
   - Equipment recovery methods

3. Command and Control
   - Decision-making under pressure
   - Communication in urban terrain
   - Tactical control measures
   - Battle tracking procedures
   - Leadership under stress

## AI Application Notes
