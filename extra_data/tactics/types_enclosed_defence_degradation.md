# Enclosed Defence Degradation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Platoon to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

Degradation is the Olvanan term for both delay and maneuver defense within urban
terrain. The effect on an attacker is decomposition - successive engagements
that degrade combat power and target key systems while conceding terrain to
present continuous threat via frequent, varied, and unpredictable attacks.

## Implementation

### Psychological Operations

1. Primary Effects

   - Instill sense of caution
   - Create apprehension
   - Enable dismounted advantage
   - Maintain psychological pressure
   - Shape enemy behavior

2. Deception Integration
   - Multiple defensive positions
   - Varied engagement methods
   - Unpredictable responses
   - Local counter-penetrations
   - Maintain tactical uncertainty

### Defensive Systems

1. Position Preparation

   - Continuous defensive positions
   - Multiple withdrawal routes
   - Concealed movement paths
   - Pre-planned fire positions
   - Integrated sensor networks

2. Engagement Methods
   - Remote weapon systems
   - Command detonated devices
   - Autonomous systems
   - Indirect fire support
   - Integrated obstacles

### Execution Sequence

1. Initial Actions

   - Engage from concealed positions
   - Use autonomous systems first
   - Maintain minimal signature
   - Enable rapid displacement
   - Preserve force integrity

2. Subsequent Operations
   - Execute planned withdrawals
   - Maintain continuous pressure
   - Employ varied tactics
   - Target key systems
   - Preserve combat power

## Common Errors

1. Predictable withdrawal patterns
2. Poor obstacle integration
3. Inadequate sensor coverage
4. Insufficient depth planning

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban defense
- Supports maneuver warfare
- Enables force preservation

## Training Considerations

1. Withdrawal procedures
2. System integration
3. Obstacle employment
4. Sensor management

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for withdrawal timing
- Essential for system coordination
- Key for obstacle planning
- Important for sensor integration
