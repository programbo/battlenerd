# Complex Envelopment Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open to Urban Terrain
- Scale: Battalion Detachment (BDET) level
- Domain: Combined Arms Operations

## Tactical Definition

Complex Envelopment Attack involves assault along multiple flanks, where a flank
is defined as any area where the enemy has not concentrated defenses, does not
expect an attack, or is vulnerable. This differs from Simple Envelopment Attack
which assaults along only one flank.

## Implementation

### Force Organization

1. Task Organization

   - Frontline Attack Groups
   - Depth Groups
   - Firepower Group
   - Situational Reserve (from frontline groups)

2. Enemy Assessment
   - Company-sized motorized combat team
   - Defensive positions along Main Supply Route (MSR)
   - Analyze vulnerabilities and gaps
   - Identify potential flanking routes

### Phase 1: Initial Actions

1. Frontline Operations

   - Conduct demonstrations/feint attacks
   - Fix enemy forward positions
   - Deceive enemy commander about:
     - Main assault axis
     - Attack strength

2. Fire Support
   - Firepower group delivers indirect fires
   - Target command elements and reserves
   - Disrupt enemy forces
   - Suppress fires
   - Deploy obscuration for depth attack groups

### Phase 2: Main Attack

1. Depth Attack Groups

   - Execute enveloping maneuver
   - Penetrate deep into enemy rear
   - Threaten exposed enemy flank
   - Cut off retreat routes

2. Deception Operations
   - Critical for depth attack success
   - Mask strength and axis of attack
   - Enable strikes from unexpected directions
   - Target areas of weakness

## Common Errors

1. Poor deception execution
2. Inadequate flank security
3. Loss of coordination between elements
4. Insufficient fire support

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Combines with deception operations
- Supports larger offensive operations
- Enables exploitation of success

## Training Considerations

1. Multi-unit coordination
2. Deception operation procedures
3. Fire support integration
4. Reserve employment criteria

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for synchronizing multiple elements
- Essential for deception planning
- Key for fire support coordination
- Important for timing calculations
