# Storming Attack (Blooming Lotus)

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Platoon level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Engineering Support

## Tactical Definition

The Storming Attack (Blooming Lotus) involves rapid penetration into an
objective area using explosives and engineering equipment to create breaches
prior to clearing. This tactic emphasizes maximum shock effect and deliberately
avoids vulnerable entry points like doorways and stairwells, instead creating
new entry points through walls and floors.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Initial Breach

1. Engineering Preparation

   - Deploy Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) for initial breach
   - Position Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) for cover
   - Establish fire support positions
   - Prepare multiple breach options
   - Calculate explosive requirements
   - Verify structural integrity
   - Establish security elements

2. Fire Support
   - AFVs deliver precision main gun rounds
   - Create clear entry breach at building end
   - Target ceiling/floor interface points
   - Switch to rapid cannon fire
   - Engage upper levels systematically
   - Maintain suppressive fires
   - Enable breach exploitation

### Phase 2: Building Penetration

1. Engineering Movement

   - Engineering team follows UGV through breach
   - Move rapidly through building interior
   - Place sequential breaching charges
   - Create multiple entry/exit points
   - Maintain forward momentum
   - Support follow-on elements
   - Document breach locations

2. Support Elements
   - Infantry sections follow engineers
   - Provide immediate local security
   - Clear rooms progressively
   - Maintain communications
   - Support subsequent breaches
   - Enable rapid movement
   - Preserve tactical tempo

### Phase 3: Multi-Building Operations

1. Building-to-Building Movement

   - Breach out of first objective building
   - Use obscuration between buildings
   - Maintain tactical tempo throughout
   - Continue systematic breaching sequence
   - Support movement with AFV fire
   - Enable rapid transitions
   - Preserve combat power

2. Clearance Operations
   - Deploy UAS for reconnaissance
   - Identify targets for AFV engagement
   - Use pole charges for internal breaching
   - Maintain assault momentum
   - Establish security positions
   - Document cleared areas
   - Enable follow-on forces

### Security Operations

1. External Security

   - Maintain all-round security
   - Monitor adjacent structures
   - Position support weapons
   - Control access routes
   - Enable reinforcement
   - Support breach teams
   - Preserve tactical integrity

2. Internal Security
   - Establish strong points
   - Control movement routes
   - Monitor potential threats
   - Maintain communications
   - Enable rapid response
   - Document cleared areas
   - Support follow-on forces

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Poor explosive calculation
   - Inadequate support fire
   - Loss of tactical momentum
   - Weak breach assessment
   - Limited contingency planning

2. Tactical Failures
   - Poor coordination
   - Inadequate security
   - Weak command and control
   - Insufficient rehearsal
   - Loss of tactical tempo

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban offensive operations
- Supports rapid building clearance
- Enables force projection
- Maintains tactical surprise
- Supports follow-on operations
- Facilitates shock action
- Preserves combat power
- Maintains operational tempo

## Training Considerations

1. Technical Skills

   - Explosive breaching procedures
   - UGV/AFV integration methods
   - Building clearance techniques
   - Inter-building movement
   - Equipment maintenance

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Breach point selection
   - Fire support coordination
   - Movement techniques
   - Communication protocols
   - Emergency procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for breach point selection
- Essential for explosive calculations
- Key for movement timing
- Important for fire support coordination
- Vital for security positioning
- Crucial for tactical assessment
- Enables pattern recognition
- Supports decision-making
