# Snatch Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Platoon level (30-40 personnel)
- Domain: Infantry with Mechanized Support

## Tactical Definition

A rapid conventional attack designed to seize positions across an unprepared
defense to cause sudden collapse. This tactic requires no special capabilities
beyond standard infantry platoon equipment and Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs),
accepting some risk to maximize speed, shock, and surprise effect.

## Implementation

### Mechanical Breach Variant

1. Vehicle Preparation

   - Position Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) in covered locations
   - Prepare frame-mounted breaching charges on vehicles
   - Platoon commander's vehicle held in reserve
   - Establish overwatch positions with heavy weapons
   - Maintain situational awareness through UAS
   - Rehearse breach sequence
   - Verify communications systems

2. Breach Execution

   - Two ZBD-05s reverse into building simultaneously
   - Use frame-mounted charges for initial breach
   - Create entry point on building exterior
   - Commander's vehicle provides covering fire
   - Maintain upper floor suppression
   - Enable rapid dismount
   - Secure immediate area

3. Exploitation
   - Rapid dismount inside building
   - Seize initial foothold
   - Use AFV for upper floor access
   - Clear both levels simultaneously
   - Establish internal security

### Exploitation Phase

1. Initial Entry

   - Rapid dismount inside breached building
   - Seize and secure initial foothold
   - Use AFV platforms for upper floor access
   - Clear both levels simultaneously
   - Establish internal security positions
   - Maintain momentum of assault
   - Enable follow-on forces

2. Building Clearance
   - Systematic room clearance procedures
   - Maintain tactical tempo
   - Establish internal strong points
   - Control key access points
   - Enable subsequent operations
   - Document cleared areas
   - Preserve evidence as required

### Alternative Methods

1. Explosive Breach

   - Deploy specialized demolition teams
   - Place shaped charges at weak points
   - Create multiple simultaneous entry points
   - Maintain supporting fire throughout
   - Execute coordinated entry
   - Support follow-on forces
   - Maintain tactical surprise

2. Fire Support Breach
   - AFV main gun creates initial entry
   - Multiple precision rounds on exterior
   - Target ceiling/floor interface points
   - Switch to rapid cannon fire
   - Support internal clearance teams
   - Maintain suppressive fires
   - Enable rapid exploitation

### Security Operations

1. External Security

   - Maintain all-round security
   - Monitor adjacent structures
   - Prepare for enemy counterattack
   - Establish observation posts
   - Position ready reaction force
   - Control access routes
   - Enable reinforcement

2. Internal Security
   - Establish internal strong points
   - Control key movement routes
   - Monitor potential threats
   - Maintain communications
   - Enable rapid response
   - Document cleared areas
   - Prepare contingency plans

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Poor breach point selection
   - Inadequate supporting fires
   - Slow exploitation of breach
   - Weak internal security
   - Limited contingency planning

2. Tactical Failures
   - Loss of momentum
   - Poor coordination
   - Inadequate security
   - Weak command and control
   - Insufficient rehearsal

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports urban offensive operations
- Enables rapid building seizure
- Facilitates shock action
- Maintains tactical surprise
- Supports follow-on operations
- Enables force projection
- Preserves combat power
- Maintains operational tempo

## Training Considerations

1. Technical Skills

   - Mechanical breach procedures
   - Vehicle-infantry coordination
   - Internal clearance methods
   - Security establishment
   - Equipment maintenance

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Breach point selection
   - Fire support coordination
   - Movement techniques
   - Communication protocols
   - Emergency procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for breach point selection
- Essential for timing coordination
- Key for force protection planning
- Important for clearance sequencing
- Vital for security positioning
- Crucial for fire support
- Enables tactical assessment
- Supports decision-making
