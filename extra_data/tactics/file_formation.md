# File Formation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Close/Urban Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations

## Tactical Definition

The File (or Single File) Formation is employed in close terrain where ability
to extend across a broad front is limited, such as jungle, thick foliage, or
urban settings. This formation is used when speed of movement along a road/track
is more important than tactical acumen, particularly when traveling along narrow
tracks or defiles.

## Implementation

### Basic Organization

1. Movement Structure

   - Staggered formation on track/road
   - Alternating sides for each soldier
   - Maintains tactical spacing (5-10m)
   - Enables rapid reaction to contact
   - Provides mutual support capability
   - Facilitates command and control
   - Supports rapid deployment

2. Element Positioning
   - Point element leads formation
   - Command element positioned centrally
   - Support weapons distributed throughout
   - Rear security element trails
   - Maintains tactical integrity
   - Enables immediate action drills
   - Supports all-round security

### Tactical Considerations

1. Route Selection

   - Avoid likely ambush points and danger areas
   - Use terrain features for maximum protection
   - Consider multiple alternate routes
   - Plan emergency actions and rally points
   - Maintain tactical awareness throughout
   - Identify covered positions along route
   - Establish emergency rendezvous points

2. Security Measures
   - Point man maintains forward security
   - Rear security element provides early warning
   - All-round observation continuously maintained
   - Ready reaction to contact procedures
   - Immediate action drills prepared and rehearsed
   - Counter-tracking measures employed
   - Security halts conducted regularly

### Movement Procedures

1. Spacing Control

   - Maintain 5-10 meter intervals
   - Adjust spacing based on terrain/visibility
   - Ensure visual contact with adjacent elements
   - Control movement speed for cohesion
   - Maintain tactical integrity
   - Enable mutual support capability
   - Support immediate action drills

2. Formation Discipline
   - Silent movement techniques
   - Hand signal communication
   - Light/noise discipline
   - Maintain situational awareness
   - Regular security checks
   - Counter-tracking procedures
   - Emergency rally procedures

### Contact Response

1. Initial Actions

   - Immediate reaction to contact drills
   - Deploy smoke for obscuration
   - Move to nearest covered positions
   - Establish base of fire
   - Enable maneuver elements
   - Maintain unit integrity
   - Execute battle drills

2. Maneuver Options
   - Break contact if necessary
   - Use terrain for covered withdrawal
   - Maintain unit cohesion throughout
   - Execute practiced contact drills
   - Reform for counterattack if required
   - Establish security positions
   - Coordinate supporting fires

## Common Errors

1. Movement Discipline

   - Poor route selection and planning
   - Inadequate spacing between elements
   - Loss of tactical awareness
   - Weak flank security measures
   - Insufficient rehearsal of drills

2. Security Failures
   - Inadequate observation
   - Poor noise/light discipline
   - Weak counter-tracking measures
   - Limited contingency planning
   - Insufficient security halts

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports movement through restricted terrain
- Enables rapid deployment when required
- Facilitates urban movement
- Supports infiltration operations
- Enables covert movement
- Supports reconnaissance operations
- Facilitates night operations
- Enables tactical flexibility

## Training Considerations

1. Movement Techniques

   - Formation maintenance procedures
   - Contact drill rehearsals
   - Route selection methods
   - Security procedures
   - Counter-tracking techniques

2. Battle Drills
   - Contact response procedures
   - Rally point procedures
   - Emergency rendezvous
   - Casualty evacuation
   - Break contact drills

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for route planning optimization
- Essential for spacing calculations
- Key for security positioning
- Important for reaction timing
- Vital for pattern analysis
- Crucial for terrain utilization
- Enables tactical assessment
- Supports decision-making
