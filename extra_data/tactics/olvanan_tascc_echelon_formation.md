# Echelon Formation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open to Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations

## Tactical Definition

The Echelon Formation is a rarely employed tactical formation typically utilized
as part of a larger formation where a squad patrols one of the flanks of the
platoon. Used when enemy positions are likely to be encountered toward the front
and flank of the squad, providing maximum firepower in both directions.

## Implementation

### Basic Organization

1. Formation Structure

   - Teams positioned in stepped pattern to flank
   - Link positions maintain visual contact
   - Equal spacing between elements
   - Maximum frontage based on terrain
   - Depth varies with threat level
   - Maintains tactical flexibility
   - Enables flank protection

2. Command and Control
   - Squad commander controls movement
   - Positioned for optimal control
   - Maintains communication throughout
   - Coordinates tactical responses
   - Directs supporting elements
   - Controls movement speed
   - Manages formation spacing

### Tactical Employment

1. Terrain Considerations

   - Used primarily in open country
   - Optimal dispersion for protection
   - Protection from indirect/direct fire
   - One flank protected by terrain/forces
   - Enables mutual support
   - Maintains visual contact
   - Supports rapid deployment

2. Security Measures
   - Link positions maintain contact
   - Visual observation of other squads
   - Maintain relative positions
   - Provide mutual support
   - Enable rapid response
   - Continuous security scanning
   - Immediate action capability

### Multi-Unit Operations

1. Squad Integration

   - Most effective with multiple squads
   - Each provides directional security
   - Coordinated movement essential
   - Maintains formation integrity
   - Enables tactical flexibility
   - Supports mutual reinforcement
   - Facilitates fire support

2. Contact Response
   - Immediate support to contact
   - Flanking fire capability
   - Coordinated response options
   - Maintains tactical cohesion
   - Enables rapid maneuver
   - Supports fire and movement
   - Preserves formation integrity

## Common Errors

1. Formation Control

   - Loss of visual contact
   - Poor coordination between units
   - Inadequate flank security
   - Improper spacing maintenance
   - Weak command and control

2. Movement Discipline
   - Poor terrain utilization
   - Inadequate security measures
   - Loss of formation integrity
   - Weak mutual support
   - Insufficient flexibility

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for flank security
- Supports larger formations
- Enables coordinated response
- Facilitates mutual support
- Supports fire and movement
- Enables rapid deployment
- Maintains tactical flexibility
- Supports offensive operations

## Training Considerations

1. Formation Maintenance

   - Visual contact procedures
   - Spacing control methods
   - Movement coordination
   - Security measures
   - Communication protocols

2. Unit Coordination
   - Inter-squad procedures
   - Support coordination
   - Contact drills
   - Battle handover
   - Emergency actions

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for formation planning
- Essential for unit spacing
- Key for coordination timing
- Important for terrain analysis
- Vital for pattern recognition
- Crucial for movement planning
- Enables tactical assessment
- Supports decision-making
