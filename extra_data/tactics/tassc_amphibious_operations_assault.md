# Amphibious Operations

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Littoral/Maritime/Urban
- Scale: Division/Multi-Brigade
- Domain: Combined Arms with Naval Integration

## Tactical Definition

A key pillar of Olvanan naval doctrine, emphasizing the use of existing port
facilities over contested beach assaults due to limited contemporary amphibious
operational experience. Operations require extensive surveillance and shaping
campaigns.

## Implementation

### Preparatory Phase

1. Area Assessment

   - Survey minimum two amphibious objective areas
   - Evaluate port infrastructure capabilities:
     - Deep water berths
     - Reinforced wharfs
     - Shore-based cranes
   - Assess disembarkation capabilities

2. Infrastructure Development
   - Foreign aid investment in local ports
   - Direct infrastructure development
   - Financial leverage over political leaders
   - Intelligence personnel integration
   - Special forces infiltration

### Surveillance Operations

1. Collection Platforms

   - Yuan Class submarines
   - Dong Diao oceanographic vessels
   - Y-8 Maritime Patrol Aircraft
   - Integrated sensor networks
   - Human intelligence sources

2. Area Preparation
   - Establish observation posts
   - Deploy sensor networks
   - Position special forces elements
   - Conduct hydrographic surveys
   - Map defensive positions

### Assault Phase

1. Force Protection

   - Carrier provides air superiority
   - J-15s conduct combat air patrol
   - Submarine screen at choke points
   - Z-9 helicopters for ASW
   - Layered defense system

2. Landing Operations
   - Sequential port entry
   - Rapid equipment offload
   - Lou Yang destroyer fire support
   - Continuous resupply
   - Area security establishment

## Common Errors

1. Insufficient preparation time
2. Poor intelligence integration
3. Weak local infrastructure
4. Inadequate force protection

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports power projection
- Enables force deployment
- Facilitates area control

## Training Considerations

1. Port operation procedures
2. Naval integration methods
3. Force protection measures
4. Logistics management

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for operation planning
- Essential for timing calculations
- Key for force protection
- Important for logistics coordination
