# Line Formation

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Dismounted Infantry Operations

## Tactical Definition

The Line Formation is employed in open country when enemy engagement is likely
from the front or when assaulting a known enemy position. Traditional team
structures are removed to provide greater centralized control to the commander,
maximizing forward firepower and enabling coordinated assault actions.

## Implementation

### Basic Organization

1. Command Element

   - Squad commander positioned in middle of forward line
   - Squad Second-in-Command (2IC) and rifleman with heavy weapons centrally
     rear
   - Grenadiers with High Explosive (HE) weapons on formation edges
   - Enables rapid coordination of personnel
   - Maximizes forward firepower
   - Maintains tactical control
   - Supports rapid maneuver

2. Weapons Distribution
   - Machine Guns (MG) and Grenade Launchers (GL) centrally located
   - Anti-armor elements distributed along line
   - Support weapons positioned for maximum effect
   - Maintains overlapping fields of fire
   - Enables concentrated firepower forward
   - Supports mutual fire support
   - Facilitates fire control

### Movement Considerations

1. Formation Control

   - Used with other elements providing flank security
   - Part of larger echelon typically
   - Not used for routine patrols
   - Limited maneuver flexibility
   - Maximum firepower forward
   - Requires careful coordination
   - Maintains formation integrity

2. Security Requirements
   - Requires flank security from other units
   - Vulnerable to envelopment
   - Limited rear security
   - Must maintain unit cohesion
   - Requires careful coordination
   - Continuous security scanning
   - Immediate action capability

### Tactical Employment

1. Assault Operations

   - Ideal for known enemy positions
   - Maximizes assault firepower
   - Enables coordinated advance
   - Maintains command and control
   - Supports fire and movement
   - Facilitates mutual support
   - Enables rapid deployment

2. Formation Limitations
   - Poor all-round defense
   - Limited depth in formation
   - Vulnerable to flank attack
   - Requires additional security elements
   - Restricted to specific scenarios
   - High command coordination needs
   - Limited tactical flexibility

### Combat Operations

1. Fire Control

   - Centralized fire control
   - Coordinated fire distribution
   - Maximum forward firepower
   - Integrated support weapons
   - Clear sectors of fire
   - Mutual support capability
   - Rapid target engagement

2. Movement Control
   - Coordinated advance procedures
   - Maintains formation alignment
   - Controls movement speed
   - Enables tactical pauses
   - Supports fire and movement
   - Facilitates command and control
   - Preserves formation integrity

## Common Errors

1. Formation Control

   - Insufficient flank security
   - Poor coordination with supporting elements
   - Over-extension of line
   - Inadequate depth
   - Loss of formation cohesion

2. Fire Control
   - Poor fire distribution
   - Weak mutual support
   - Limited sector coverage
   - Inadequate weapon coordination
   - Insufficient fire control

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports assault operations
- Enables maximum firepower forward
- Requires supporting formations
- Integrates with fire support
- Supports offensive operations
- Enables coordinated advance
- Facilitates command and control
- Maximizes combat power

## Training Considerations

1. Formation Procedures

   - Line maintenance drills
   - Movement coordination
   - Fire control measures
   - Security integration
   - Command and control

2. Combat Operations
   - Fire distribution procedures
   - Movement coordination
   - Support integration
   - Security measures
   - Emergency actions

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for formation spacing
- Essential for fire distribution
- Key for movement coordination
- Important for security calculation
- Vital for command and control
- Crucial for combat power
- Enables tactical assessment
- Supports decision-making
