# Mechanized Section Urban Assault

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Section level (8-12 personnel)
- Domain: Combined Arms with Infantry Fighting Vehicle Integration

## Tactical Definition

The smallest Olvanan grouping for urban offensive action, centered around the
section second in command (2IC) and two soldiers executing core tasks while
remaining section members perform supporting roles. The tactic emphasizes
integrated operation between dismounted elements and their Infantry Fighting
Vehicle (IFV) to maximize combat power while minimizing exposure.

## Implementation

### Breach Methods

1. Reverse Ram Breach

   - Optimum method for building assault
   - IFV executes reverse ram breach technique
   - Dismounts enter directly into objective
   - Vehicle provides immediate fire support
   - Maintains tactical momentum
   - Minimizes personnel exposure
   - Enables rapid exploitation

2. Alternative Methods
   - Hold vehicle against building side
   - Use hull for climbing to upper windows
   - Execute under obscuration cover
   - Maintain vehicle support throughout
   - Enable vertical maneuver options
   - Provide multiple entry points
   - Support rapid building access

### Assault Sequence

1. Initial Actions

   - UAS conducts pre-breach reconnaissance
   - Loudspeaker calls for surrender protocol
   - IFVs halt using available cover positions
   - Main gun creates clear breach point
   - Multiple rounds at ceiling/floor interface
   - Establish security positions
   - Enable breach exploitation

2. Building Entry
   - Pole soldier extends ladder through breach
   - Fits breaching charge in mounting bracket
   - Team readies for supporting cannon fire
   - Gunner traverses first level systematically
   - Maintains suppressive fire coverage
   - Enables rapid vertical movement
   - Supports follow-on elements

### Clearance Operations

1. Internal Movement

   - Pole soldier extends ladder through ceiling rupture
   - 2IC tests ladder stability before use
   - Team clears through breach methodically
   - Uses additional breaching charges as needed
   - Maintains tactical momentum
   - Establishes security positions
   - Enables vertical maneuver

2. Follow-on Actions
   - 2IC confers with section commander
   - Drone probes broken windows for threats
   - Gunner tracks for immediate engagement
   - Systematic room clearance procedures
   - Maintain golden rule: no humans first
   - Document cleared areas
   - Support subsequent operations

### Security Operations

1. External Security

   - Maintain all-round security
   - Monitor adjacent structures
   - Position support weapons
   - Control access routes
   - Enable reinforcement
   - Support breach teams
   - Preserve tactical integrity

2. Internal Security
   - Establish strong points
   - Control movement routes
   - Monitor potential threats
   - Maintain communications
   - Enable rapid response
   - Document cleared areas
   - Support follow-on forces

## Common Errors

1. Technical Mistakes

   - Poor breach point selection
   - Inadequate obscuration measures
   - Loss of vehicle-infantry coordination
   - Insufficient proofing operations
   - Limited contingency planning

2. Tactical Failures
   - Poor coordination
   - Inadequate security
   - Weak command and control
   - Insufficient rehearsal
   - Loss of tactical tempo

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Essential for urban offensive operations
- Supports building clearance operations
- Enables vertical maneuver capability
- Maintains tactical surprise
- Supports follow-on operations
- Facilitates shock action
- Preserves combat power
- Maintains operational tempo

## Training Considerations

1. Technical Skills

   - Vehicle-infantry integration procedures
   - Breaching techniques and procedures
   - Internal movement methods
   - Proofing operations
   - Equipment maintenance

2. Tactical Procedures
   - Breach point selection
   - Fire support coordination
   - Movement techniques
   - Communication protocols
   - Emergency procedures

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for breach point selection
- Essential for timing coordination
- Key for fire support planning
- Important for clearance sequencing
- Vital for security positioning
- Crucial for tactical assessment
- Enables pattern recognition
- Supports decision-making
