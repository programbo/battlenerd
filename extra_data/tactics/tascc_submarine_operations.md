# Submarine Operations

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Maritime Domain
- Scale: Strategic/Operational
- Domain: Naval Operations with A2AD Focus

## Tactical Definition

Submarine operations form a key component of Olvanan maritime Anti-Access Area
Denial (A2AD) strategy, emphasizing long-term influence of battlespace through
political and economic means, tactical deception, and denial of enemy
intelligence.

## Implementation

### Force Composition

1. Submarine Classes

   - Jin Class: Ballistic missile submarines (nuclear deterrent)
   - Shang Class: Nuclear-powered attack submarines
   - Song Class: Diesel-electric attack submarines
   - Yuan Class: Air-independent propulsion submarines
   - Kilo Class: ISR-focused diesel-electric submarines

2. Deployment Pattern
   - Two Jin class continuously at sea
     - One in near seas
     - One in distant seas
   - Independent operations in large patrol boxes
   - No requirement for surface coordination

### A2AD Operations

1. Detection Systems

   - Great Underwater Wall sonar network
   - Surface towed array platforms
   - Long-range UAV integration
   - Fixed sensor systems
   - Strategic headquarters coordination

2. Response Protocol
   - Immediate queuing of hostile submarines
   - Surface combatant redirection
   - Maritime patrol aircraft tasking
   - ASW helicopter deployment
   - Submarine force reposition

### Communication Protocols

1. Standard Operations

   - Daily periscope depth communications
   - Satellite link updates
   - Variable timing for deception
   - Mission status reports
   - Next communication schedule

2. Target Engagement
   - Direct targeting via satellite
   - Immediate launch capability
   - Anti-ship cruise missiles
   - Submerged redeployment options
   - Coordinated strikes possible in near seas

## Common Errors

1. Over-reliance on external queuing
2. Poor coordination in dense areas
3. Communication schedule predictability
4. Insufficient ASW integration

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports maritime A2AD strategy
- Enables strategic deterrence
- Facilitates ISR operations

## Training Considerations

1. Independent operation protocols
2. Communication procedures
3. Target engagement criteria
4. ASW coordination methods

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for patrol pattern planning
- Essential for communication timing
- Key for target prioritization
- Important for force distribution
