# Company Detachment (CDET) Quick Attack

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Open to Urban Terrain
- Scale: Company Detachment level
- Domain: Combined Arms with UAS Integration

## Tactical Definition

A rapid assault conducted by a Company Detachment (CDET) upon identification of
enemy forces, emphasizing the integrated use of mounted and dismounted elements
in contested operational zones.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Target Acquisition

1. Initial Detection

   - High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) UAV reconnaissance
   - Identify enemy forces establishing positions
   - Gather intelligence on:
     - Enemy strength
     - Defensive layout
   - Rapid dissemination to CDET

2. Planning
   - Commander rapid threat assessment
   - Identify optimal attack point
   - Prepare for swift engagement
   - Plan to strike before prepared defenses established

### Phase 2: Assault

1. Movement to Contact

   - Mechanized units advance tactically
   - Utilize vehicular mobility
   - Maintain protective cover
   - Exploit surprise factor

2. Dismounted Operations

   - Infantry dismount at designated point
   - Use terrain features (e.g., creek lines)
   - Maintain concealment
   - Position near objective area

3. Fire Support
   - Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) deploy infantry
   - Calculate distance to minimize anti-armor threat
   - Use smoke munitions for concealment
   - Platoon senior sergeant coordinates AFV fire

### Phase 3: Objective Actions

1. Break-in Drill

   - Advance to ultimate assault line
   - Position for proximity to enemy
   - Avoid defensive explosives
   - Launch team strikes key points
   - Deploy flame smoke for isolation

2. Clearance Operations
   - Execute decisive break-in drill
   - Use grenades and charges
   - Maintain assault momentum
   - Senior sergeant controls supporting fire

## Common Errors

1. Poor dismount point selection
2. Inadequate fire support coordination
3. Loss of momentum during assault
4. Insufficient use of smoke/obscuration

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Combines with fire support planning
- Supports rapid exploitation
- Enables surprise attack

## Training Considerations

1. Mounted/dismounted integration
2. Fire support coordination
3. Break-in drill procedures
4. Smoke employment techniques

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for timing calculations
- Essential for fire support planning
- Key for movement coordination
- Important for smoke modeling
