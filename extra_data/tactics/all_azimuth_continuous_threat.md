# All Azimuth Continuous Threat (AACT)

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Squad to Company level
- Domain: Combined Arms with Autonomous Systems

## Tactical Definition

All Azimuth Continuous Threat (AACT) is a defensive concept that creates
persistent threat to attacking forces from all directions through the
integration of autonomous systems, remote weapons, and dismounted elements. The
tactic emphasizes minimal exposure of defending forces while maintaining maximum
pressure on enemy units.

## Implementation

### System Integration

1. Sensor Network

   - Deploy comprehensive surveillance coverage
   - Integrate multi-spectral detection systems
   - Enable automated threat identification
   - Establish early warning capability
   - Monitor dead spaces and gaps
   - Maintain redundant systems
   - Enable rapid response

2. Weapons Employment
   - Position Remote Weapon Stations (RWS)
   - Establish interlocking fields of fire
   - Deploy autonomous weapon systems
   - Enable standoff engagement
   - Maintain mutual support
   - Integrate indirect fires
   - Preserve combat power

### Defensive Organization

1. Position Layout

   - Establish 360-degree coverage
   - Create interlocking sectors of fire
   - Position observation posts
   - Enable mutual support
   - Maintain tactical depth
   - Plan displacement routes
   - Support rapid reinforcement

2. Force Distribution
   - Disperse elements in depth
   - Maintain tactical reserves
   - Position support weapons
   - Enable rapid concentration
   - Support mutual reinforcement
   - Maintain unit integrity
   - Preserve combat power

### Combat Operations

1. Engagement Planning

   - Establish engagement criteria
   - Coordinate fire distribution
