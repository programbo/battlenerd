# Canyon Flight Tactics

## Classification

UNCLASSIFIED // FOUO

## Tactical Context

- Environment: Urban/Complex Terrain
- Scale: Aircraft/UAS Operations
- Domain: Combined Arms with Air Integration

## Tactical Definition

Canyon Flight is a tactical air movement technique conducted below the mean
crest of urban structures, specifically designed to mitigate enemy Counter-UAS
(CUAS) capabilities. This technique evolved from Olvanan urban warfare doctrine
and enables both force projection and reconnaissance while maintaining maximum
survivability of air assets.

## Implementation

### Flight Planning

1. Route Selection

   - Maintain flight path below mean building crest height
   - Identify and map continuous urban canyons
   - Plan multiple ingress/egress routes
   - Map all potential emergency landing zones
   - Identify radar/electronic warfare blind spots
   - Calculate building shadow patterns
   - Plan for time-of-day considerations

2. Platform Considerations
   - Light reconnaissance UAS platforms
   - Armed loitering munitions
   - Tactical resupply drones
   - Specialized urban terrain variants
   - Enhanced obstacle avoidance systems
   - Redundant navigation capabilities
   - Reduced electronic signature systems

### Tactical Employment

1. Counter-CUAS Measures

   - Exploit building masking against radar
   - Use terrain following algorithms
   - Employ emission control protocols
   - Execute random course changes
   - Utilize thermal masking techniques
   - Deploy electronic countermeasures
   - Maintain unpredictable timing

2. Mission Integration
   - Coordinate with ground force movements
   - Support building clearance operations
   - Enable rapid force projection
   - Provide real-time reconnaissance
   - Maintain secure communications links
   - Support precision fires missions
   - Enable battle damage assessment

### Risk Mitigation

1. Flight Safety

   - Real-time obstacle detection/avoidance
   - Urban wind effect monitoring
   - Emergency landing procedures
   - Alternative route activation
   - Platform-specific limitations
   - Minimum separation distances
   - Weather impact assessment

2. Tactical Risks
   - Enemy air defense capabilities
   - Local defensive system locations
   - Civilian population density
   - Communication dead zones
   - GPS denied environments
   - Electronic warfare threats
   - Counter-UAS system locations

## Common Errors

1. Inadequate urban terrain analysis
2. Poor obstacle detection planning
3. Excessive predictable routing
4. Communication plan failures
5. Insufficient alternative routes
6. Weather effect miscalculation

## Integration with Other Tactics

- Supports urban assault operations
- Enables precision strike missions
- Facilitates force reconnaissance
- Enhances command and control
- Supports deception operations

## Training Considerations

1. Urban navigation techniques
2. Platform-specific capabilities
3. Emergency procedure rehearsal
4. Integration with ground forces
5. Electronic warfare response
6. Civilian consideration protocols

## AI Application Notes

- Critical for route optimization
- Essential for obstacle avoidance
- Key for timing coordination
- Important for risk assessment
