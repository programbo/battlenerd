## Mission Analysis

### Higher Intent

The strategic framework for Operation Steel Sentinel is established by UN
Security Council Resolution 8873, which authorizes an international task force
to expel North Torbian forces from Belesian territory. The mandate emphasizes
creating a safe and secure environment while facilitating the continuation of
Belesian democratic governance.

At the operational level, the focus is on establishing military superiority in
maritime and air domains to enable decisive operations that will restore
Belesian sovereignty. This includes supporting humanitarian assistance efforts
and enabling democratic institutions throughout the area of operations.

### Terrain Analysis (OCOKA)

1. Observation/Fields of Fire The area of operations presents diverse
   observation challenges across multiple domains. Coastal observation points
   along Panay and Palawan provide key maritime surveillance positions. North
   Torbian forces have established an ADIZ over occupied islands and maintain a
   Maritime Exclusion Zone. Urban terrain, particularly in Roxas City and around
   the San Rafael mine complex, creates complex observation and fields of fire
   considerations requiring careful integration of ground, air, and maritime
   surveillance capabilities.

2. Cover/Concealment The terrain offers significant cover and concealment
   opportunities. Urban areas provide superior physical and electromagnetic
   concealment capabilities, particularly valuable given enemy UAS capabilities.
   The heavily forested mountains in northern Panay and deep valleys create
   natural movement corridors. Island chains enable maritime concealment, while
   complex terrain enables effective implementation of 3D defilade positions for
   both defensive and offensive operations.

3. Obstacles Natural and man-made obstacles significantly influence operations
   throughout the AO. Maritime chokepoints in the Sulu and South China Seas
   restrict naval movement options. Mountain ranges channel ground movement
   along predictable corridors. In urban areas, particularly Roxas City, rubble
   and North Torbian defensive positions create significant tactical challenges.
   Intelligence indicates extensive mining and fortification of likely approach
   routes.

4. Key Terrain Critical terrain features center around strategic infrastructure
   and urban centers. The San Rafael cerium mine complex represents both an
   economic and tactical objective. El Nido airfields on Palawan provide
   essential air access. Strategic ports including Roxas City SPOD, Iloilo City
   SPOD, and the alternate port at Caticlan enable maritime power projection.
   Urban centers, particularly Roxas City and Iloilo City, will be decisive for
   both military operations and subsequent stability operations.

5. Avenues of Approach Multiple domains offer potential avenues of approach.
   Maritime routes through the Sulu and South China Seas provide access for
   amphibious operations. Air corridors over the island chains enable both air
   assault and air support operations. Ground approaches are well-defined by
   terrain and infrastructure:
   - Route ORANGE connects Iloilo City through Calinog to Tapaz
   - Route PURPLE links Calinog through Passi to the San Rafael mine
   - Route BLUE provides access from Roxas City through Kalibo to Caticlan
   - Route GREEN connects Iloilo City through Passi to Roxas City
   - Route RED runs from Iloilo City through Banate to Sara
   - Route MAGENTA links Roxas City through Pilar to Estancia

### Time Analysis

The operation is structured in five distinct phases, each with critical timing
considerations:

Phase 0 (Shaping) extends from D-60 to D-11, focusing on theater preparation.
This phase encompasses force deployment, RSO&I activities, command post
establishment, coalition force integration, and intelligence gathering
operations. The extended timeline reflects the complexity of deploying and
integrating multinational forces.

Phase 1 (Denial), from D-10 to D-1, concentrates on isolating NTMEF forces
through interdiction of supply lines and degradation of enemy capabilities. This
phase includes critical deception operations and the establishment of
air/maritime superiority. The compressed timeline demands precise coordination
of joint effects.

Phase 2 (Lodgement), D-Day to D+2, represents the critical transition to
offensive operations through Joint Force Entry Operations. This phase requires
rapid securing of beachheads/ports, establishment of logistics nodes, and force
buildup while maintaining isolation operations. The 72-hour window demands
precise execution of complex joint operations.

Phase 3 (Neutralise), D+3 to D+14, focuses on decisive operations to defeat
NTMEF forces. Primary efforts include defeating NTMEF forces in Panay, securing
Palawan, and initiating counter-insurgency operations. This phase also begins
stability operations and humanitarian assistance coordination, recognizing the
complex civil-military environment.

Phase 4 (Transition), beginning D+15, marks the shift to UN peacekeeping
operations. This phase encompasses ongoing stability operations, information
operations, freedom of navigation operations, and anti-piracy maritime security
patrols. The timeline remains conditions-based rather than time-bound.

### Enemy Forces Analysis

North Torbian military forces represent a significant regional capability with
demonstrated ability to project power beyond their borders. Their recent actions
show sophisticated integration of military and political warfare, particularly
in their justification of operations as protection of ethnic Torbians.

Land Forces: North Torbia maintains the second largest regional army with over
500,000 active personnel and more than 2 million reservists. Their ground forces
are organized into modern mechanized and motorized divisions, supported by
extensive artillery capabilities and strong air defense networks. A key
vulnerability lies in their limited logistics sustainability, particularly in
extended operations beyond their borders.

Naval Forces: North Torbian naval capabilities include demonstrated blue water
operations with significant amphibious capability. Their surface fleet includes
modern combatants:

- Surface warfare capabilities centered on Type 052D Luyang III and Type 052C
  Luyang II destroyers
- Amphibious operations supported by Type 054A Jiangkai II frigates
- Submarine operations utilizing Type 039 Song class SSKs Their naval forces
  show sophisticated integration with Olvanan support elements but may face
  sustainability challenges in extended operations.

Air Forces: Their air component demonstrates modern capabilities with a mix of
aircraft types and a dedicated bomber force capable of reaching Western Pacific
rim targets. Current deployed assets include:

- El Nido Airfield: 12x SU-30MKK and 12x J-11B fighters
- Roxas Airport: 12x SU-30MKK, 12x J-11B fighters, plus rotary wing assets (12x
  Z-9, 6x Z-19) These forces provide significant air defense and ground attack
  capabilities within the theater.

Current Disposition: Enemy forces are organized into two main elements:

1. NTMEF 4th MAR BDE has established a staging base at El Nido, controlling
   refurbished WW2-era port and airfield facilities. This position enables
   control of maritime approaches and provides strategic depth for operations in
   Panay.

2. NTMEF 3rd MAR BDE has secured Roxas City and the strategically important San
   Rafael Mine complex. They have established defensive positions integrating
   urban terrain features and demonstrate sophisticated understanding of 3D
   defilade principles in their defensive preparations.

Support Elements: North Torbian operations benefit from significant Olvanan
support including:
